* If the person you are calling doesn’t have an iPhone, iPad, or iPod, you won’t be able to use it.

### 9\. [LINE](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/line/id443904275)

When it comes to finding the best video call app for iPhones, LINE is up there. It lets you call, message, video chat, and all through hieroglyphics like stickers, GIFs, and other mediums.

![LINE](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/line-app.JPG)

Features:

* LINE comes with all the smileys and stickers that you can dream of
* 600 million users on a growing platform
* Group calls up to 200 people

Pros:

* This is the best video call app for iPhone for those that are lazy texters
* The world’s largest online sticker collection
* Access you and your friend’s timeline

Cons:

* If you tried to hold a business meeting using LINE, they would sack you
* Aimed at the very young, we’re not even sure this demographic should have iPhones yet

### 10\. [WeChat](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wechat/id414478124)

WeChat is also aimed at the younger generations, but it is more Gen Z and less under-the-age-of-ten.

![WeChat](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/wechat-app.JPG)

Features:

* Custom sticker making, a gallery and a time capsule feature from your memories
* Direction sharing for easy meetups, mini-programs, and top stories
* Everything that Facebook has, but marketed at a younger age group

Pros:

* It’s fresh and cool
* They incorporate a healing kit and health tracking data app
* You can keep track of your teenagers with it, low key

Cons:

* Most definitely not the best business video call chat for iPhone.
