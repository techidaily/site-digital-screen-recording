Screencasting on any version of Windows 7/8/10 is a simple task, and countless software products enable you to record your desktop activities.

Most screen recorders create MP4 or MOV files that can get quite large, making them hard to send or easily distribute over the Internet.

On the other hand, GIFs are small in size, and sending them via email or posting them on social media networks won't require you to wait for a long time until the file is uploaded to the web.

However, there aren't that many screen recorders for Windows OS that let you save screen recordings as GIF files, and for that reason, we've composed the list of best **GIF Recorders** for PCs. Let's have a look at some of the most powerful software products for creating animated GIFs on Windows.

## Best GIF Recorders to Capture Animated GIFs on Windows

Here are the 8 best recorders to have gifs for you to look at.

![fraps](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/fraps-movies-settings.jpg)

Fraps is probably one of the oldest screen recorders for gaming because it was released 18 years ago, and besides providing video capture features, it can also be used for benchmarking or displaying frame rates.

Fraps don't offer support for GIF files, which means that you can only use it to create an MP.4 or AVI file that you can later convert to GIF file format. Capturing videos and still frames outside of a video game is not on the list of options the software offers.

The free version of this screen recording utility can only record 30-second videos, which limits your screencasting possibilities and makes it a perfect tool for generating short videos that can be easily converted to GIFs, at the same time.

Fraps works best with Nvidia and AMD Radeon graphics cards, and it is compatible with the most popular video games on the market.

#### 5. [VClip](https://www.videohelp.com/software/VClip)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![vclip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vclip.jpg)

This basic screencasting tool lets you capture animated GIF files, but it doesn't offer much more than that. Its users can produce GIFs that feature a full screen or select the area of the screen they want to record.

The Windows-based application allows you to select the frame rate and the output format. Besides, the GIF files VClip can also produce MP.4, AVI, OGG, or WebM files and it can capture videos at 30fps per second.

The VClip's window is transparent, and you can drag one of its corners in any direction if you'd like to extend the area of the screen you want to capture.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![sharex gif recorder](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/sharex-capture-screen-recording-option.jpg)

ShareX offers tools for screen capturing that are powerful enough to enable you to create GIF or video files. This open-source software provides many screen recording features, and it lets its users utilize the Freehand, Ellipse, and Rectangle region types.

The screen recording utility doesn't allow you to change the frame rates or select the size of the video.

The annotation tools such as speech balloons or text outlines can be added to all types of screen recordings you produce with ShareX. You can choose from several different upload methods, and you can share the file on any popular social media network, including Flickr, Twitter, or Vimeo.

ShareX also offers photo editing features, but it doesn't provide any video editing options, so making adjustments to the GIF you create with this application requires you to use another program.
