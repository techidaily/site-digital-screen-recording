## Basic Procedure: Swapping Video Playback in VLC Media Player

VLC Media Player is more than just a regular video player that plays videos of different file formats.

Besides, there are graphics equalizer and audio normalization available. But one feature that clearly stands out is **VLC rotate video** and save the video file.

You can rotate a video in VLC clockwise at 90, 180, and 270 degrees. The player also allows you to rotate videos at any arbitrary angle as per your requirement. In fact, you can flip the video horizontally and vertically as well as transpose the video as per your preference. Transposing a video means you are flipping and rotating at the same time. Rotating video in VLC is super easy, and in this article, we will explain the steps in detail.
