## 11 Ranked Audio Recorders of the Year

Meta: Looking for a way to record any streaming audio and save it on your hard drive? Here are the top 11 best streaming audio recorders.

We often come across certain songs that we want to download and listen to them in repeat without consuming the internet data pack. Similarly, we happen to listen to any podcasts where valuable information is shared, and we may want to save them for any future reference. Unfortunately, there is no download option available on the audio streaming platforms to retain the awesome music or podcast on your hard drive. That is where a streaming audio recorder comes into the scene.

A streaming audio recorder records whatever you are streaming on your computer. Therefore, you can stream your favorite song or motivational podcast, and the recorder will record streaming audio and let you save the file on your computer. There are different streaming audio recorders available such as paid recorders, free recorders, standalone software as well as online recorders.
