Besides, there are graphics equalizer and audio normalization available. But one feature that clearly stands out is **VLC rotate video** and save the video file.

You can rotate a video in VLC clockwise at 90, 180, and 270 degrees. The player also allows you to rotate videos at any arbitrary angle as per your requirement.

Step 1: Open VLC Media Player.

Step 2: Go to Media > Open File option and select the video file that you want to rotate.

Step 3: Once the video opens, go to Tools > Effects and Filters option.
