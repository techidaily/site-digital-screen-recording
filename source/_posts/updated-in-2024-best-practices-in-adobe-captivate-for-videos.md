Click on the Demo option in the Adobe Captivate's welcome window, and then click on the Create button in the lower right corner of the screen.

#### Step 2 - Select the application and designate the area of the screen you'd like to record

After you click on the Create button, a new window will appear on the screen. In the upper left corner of the window, you'll be able to see Screen Area and Application options. Select the Application feature and head over to the drop-down menu located directly below it to select the Microsoft PowerPoint application or any other app compatible with the software.

In the Snap To section of the window, you'll be able to choose between Application Window, Application Region, and Custom Size options. Select the feature that best meets the demands of the project you are working on, and then click on the Panning drop down menu if you would like to add the panning effect to the video recording you are creating. The Audio feature lets you record both narration and system audio.

#### Step 3 - Starting a new video recording session

Click on the Settings button if you wish to change the destination on your hard-drive where the video will be saved.

When the new window opens, click on the Browse icon next to the Working Folder feature, and select insert the new destination folder for your video. Above the Working Folder option is the Show Mouse in Video Demo Mode checkbox, make sure it is marked if you want the mouse cursor to be visible in the video and click OK to confirm the changes you've made.

Hit the Record button to initiate the video recording session. You can hit the Esc or End buttons to stop recording if you are using a PC, while Mac users can perform the same action by hitting Cmd + Enter keys.

#### Step 4 - Publish the video

Upon the completion of the video recording session, the Publish Video Demo window will appear on the screen. You'll be able to save your video as an MP4 file directly to your computer, or you can export the video directly to YouTube, Facebook or Twitter.

**Conclusion:**

Adobe Captivate is much more than just a simple screen recording tool, and if you want, you can use it to perform basic editing actions on your footage. You can also create PIP videos, add smart shapes to a video or insert text captions directly from the software. Did you find this article helpful?
