The fade-in effect is commonly used to slowly introduce a shot to a viewer but it can also be used to make the transition between two shots much smoother, especially when combined with the fade-out effect that is often used to conclude a shot or suggest the end of a sequence or the entire video clip.

You may already know that [professional video editing software packages](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), like Adobe Premiere, enable its users to add fade-in and fade-out effects to videos, but in this article, we are going to show you how to create add fade-in and fade-out effects to videos in easier ways. So let's explore the steps you'll need to take in order to add these effects to your videos.

## 4 Ways to Add Fade in & Fade Out Effects to Video in Filmora

If you’re using the latest version of Filmora, there’re several ways you can use to fade in and fade out clips. If you haven’t installed Filmora yet, click the button below to start.

[![Download Filmora9 Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [![Download Filmora9 Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

### 1\. Add Dissolve Transitions to Video to Fade in and Fade out Video Footage

The first way to fade in and fade out the footage in Filmora is by applying dissolve transition. The dissolve, also called lap dissolve sometimes, is a gradual transition from one image to another. It is often used when the first image starts to disappear and the next image starts to display gradually.

So you can apply Dissolve transition at the beginning of the video from a black screen to fade in, and add dissolve transition at the end of the clip into the blackness to fade out.

Here is how to add dissolve transition in Filmora.

* After importing video footage into Filmora, drag and drop them in the timeline.
* Go to the Transition tab and find Dissolve under the Basic category. If you didn’t see it, you can use the search bar to find it.
