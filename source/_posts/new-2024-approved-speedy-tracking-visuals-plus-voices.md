## Part 2\. How to Trim Videos in QuickTime Player

You may need to trim out some parts of the video to get rid of the unwanted parts and keep only the important parts. You can do the trim work easily in QuickTime Player and here are the steps to follow.

Step 1: Launch QuickTime Player and go to File > Open File option. Select the video file that you want to trim.

Step 2: Once the video file opens, go to Edit > Trim option. You can also press Command + T on your keyboard.

Step 3: You will see a yellow bar at the bottom containing the entire length of the video. In order to trim the video, you have to drag the handles from either side to trim out the unwanted parts.
