**Step 4: Stop the Recording and Export**

Once the meeting session is over, press **F9**, or right-click the **Screen Recorder** icon from the notification area, click **Open recorder**, and then click the **Stop** button from the panel that appears next to stop the recording.

Now, you can drag the recorded footage from the **Media** box to the Filmora timeline at the bottom to start editing the clip, and then can click **EXPORT** from the top of the interface to save the final version of the video that can be shared on your preferred platform or with your colleagues, team members, managers, etc.
