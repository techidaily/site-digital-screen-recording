## Netflix Memories: Capturing Every View with Mac

Netflix is one of the most popular internet streaming services, with millions of regular customers across the world.

Netflix will never be boring you with its vast selection of fascinating TV episodes and movies, including action, thrillers, and comedies. This is why Netflix has become everyone's favorite and we can't get enough of it. Netflix does, however, have certain limits.

When you go on a vacation and don't have access to Wi-Fi, you can have trouble viewing your subscription program when it airs. When it comes to screen recording Netflix, there's always the issue of whether or not it's legal. In most cases, the term "illegal" is used to denote a criminal law infringement. Recording and viewing copyrighted works for personal use rather than commercial objectives is not deemed a copyright violation, according to the regulation. You won't be able to view Netflix when your membership expires. Although Netflix allows you to download some movies with tiles, they may be withdrawn from the Netflix channel before you begin binge viewing.

****Step 4:** Open Netflix and choose Start Recording from the Controls box.

## Method 4: Use Bandicam to Record Netflix

Bandicam is a screen recorder that is both ancient and reliable. It makes use of a high compression ratio while maintaining video quality. With Bandicam, you can shoot 4K ultra-high-definition movies at 120 frames per second.

You may save screenshots in JPEG, PNG, or BMP formats. Bandicam can also capture your full computer screen, Excel spreadsheets, web browsers, PowerPoint presentations, and more. Bandicam is an excellent alternative for capturing Netflix TV episodes and movies. This is due to Bandicam's ability to record Netflix movies for up to 24 hours straight.

### Steps to Record Netflix with Bandicam

If you'd want to record your favorite TV episodes and movies using Bandicam software, follow the instructions below to learn how:

Step 1\. You must go to the browser's settings after running the app. On the left sidebar, choose the System option, then the Advanced option.

Step 2\. Turn off the "Use hardware acceleration when available" option's toggle. Then, in the upper left corner, press the Rectangle to bring up the Record screen. Now hit the Rec button on the window that displays.

Step 3\. After you've started recording, go to Netflix and search for your favorite movie using your browser. Start streaming the Netflix movie, and the Bandicam screen recorder will capture it.

Step 4\. Press the Stop button on the screen when the movie is done. Go to the Bandicam home screen and then to the video area to retrieve the recordings. This is what you must do if you want Bandicam to automatically cease recording Netflix videos.

## Method 5: Use Screencast-o-Matic to Record Netflix

The screen recorder tool in Screencast-O-Matic is its most basic function, and it is available for free. You may pick whether it will be applied to your screen, your webcam, or both. It can capture any portion of your screen. Screencast-O-Matic is a video utility tool that allows you to capture screencasts and modify them. It's a multimedia program with two membership tiers and a variety of features. The screen recorder from Screen-O-Matic may be downloaded and used for free. Meanwhile, the two premium editions unlock the video editing application and other capabilities. There are other team plans available for use in education, industry, and software development.

### Steps to Record Netflix with Screencast-o-Matic

Step 1\. Download and install the utility on your Mac, then click on it to enter the app interface once it displays on your home screen.

Step 2\. You will be asked to provide some key permissions by the program, which you must do. The start button will then appear as a red dot on your screen. After you click that, your screen recording will begin.

Step 3\. Now go to Netflix and start recording anything you want. When you're finished, click the same button to end the recording.

## Method 6: Record Netflix with Snagit

Use Snagit to record Netflix. Snagit is a sophisticated video editor and screen recorder. Snagit is more sophisticated in video recording than QuickTime Player and Netflix Screen. It's not just another YouTube recorder. It's easy to alter the recording parameters and the size of the recording window. It also allows you to use a camera and microphone to record.

### Steps to Record Netflix with Snagit

****Step 1:** After starting, go to the General Setting tab in the welcome box and change the output directory.

****Step 2:** Under the Video Setting tab, change the frame rate and bitrate and create a recording output directory and file name.

![snagit video setting](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/snagit-video-setting.jpg)

****Step 3:** Log in to your Netflix account and view the movie. Then press the REC button to begin recording Netflix right now. Keep track of your screen screenshots.

## Conclusion

Netflix has a horrible reputation for deleting TV episodes and movies from your queue before you can binge-watch them. Netflix has added a download function that enables you to save TV shows to your smartphone for offline watching. However, the capability is not available for desktop users, and what's more, these downloads expire as well. So that's how simple it is to record Netflix videos. Netflix movies may be recorded in a variety of file formats, including MP4, WMV, AVI, 3GP, and others.
