[Video chat apps](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) allow us to keep in touch with our friends and family during these difficult times without jeopardizing anyone’s safety. Mac, iPhone, or iPad users don’t have to think much about which video chat app they are going to choose as FaceTime is both free and easy to use.

Android operating systems don’t come with FaceTime’s equivalent, which is the reason why their users have to find a video chat app that best suits their needs. So, in this article, we are going to take you through some of the best free FaceTime for Android alternatives.

The best part is that you don’t have to spend a single cent to be able to communicate with a friend who has an iPhone from your Android device. Here are the ten best free video chat alternatives to FaceTime on Android.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
At the onset of the Coronavirus pandemic, the number of Skype’s users increased by 70% in a single month. This statistic alone speaks volumes about the app’s popularity, as millions of people choose to talk to their business associates or friends through Skype.

Besides being one of the most popular [cross-platform video chat apps](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) ever created, Skype is also remarkably easy to use, as you just need a webcam and a microphone to start a video call.
