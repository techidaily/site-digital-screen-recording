## Zoom Mastery for Podcasters: A Complete Guide to Exceptional Audio Capture

Are you thinking of making your podcasts but worried about how to record them? Chill, you don't need a professional studio for this purpose. There is a lot of software, but zoom podcast recording is relatively more straightforward. A podcast is a collection of audio files that you can either download or listen to online using the internet. This article will help you learn to record podcasts using zoom.

## 7-Step Formula: How To Record a Podcast on Zoom?

Recording a podcast on zoom is quite simple and easy. You don't need to be a recording expert; you can get it done at home using your laptop. In this article, I will guide you on how to record a podcast using zoom step by step.

##### Step1 Download and Install

The 1st step is downloading and installing zoom on your device. Next, create your zoom account by visiting the [zoom website](https://soft-portal.shop/zoom/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fzoom.us&id=5&geo=&ub=https%3A%2F%2Fsoft-portal.shop%2Fzoom%2F&gclid=Cj0KCQjw48OaBhDWARIsAMd966AtsDXlasyuqO9r1vrbTzSdxKyOMLNsfNLa%5FRFZ12PRcu09P4sKnMcaAlUHEALw%5FwcB). Log in to this account with your installed software and enjoy zoom free. The free version allows you to record for 40 minutes. For longer calls, purchase the paid version.

![download and install zoom](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/zoom-podcasts-recording-1.jpg)

##### Step2 Setting Up Microphone and Headphones

Zoom can use your device's built-in microphone, but it is advised to use a high-quality external mic. It enhances the quality of your podcast tremendously. Plenty of external mics are available for under 50$, which can make a real difference.

##### Step3 Eliminate Any Background Noise

No one is interested in listening to what's happening in the background while listening to your podcast. So, before pressing the 'Record' button, ensure your environment is as quiet as possible. You can take the following steps to reduce background noises.

* Turn off the fan, air conditioner, or any other noisy appliances.
* Remove noisy kids, roommates, or pets.
* Hang a 'Do Not Disturb' sign on your front door.
* Shut your door and windows to avoid noise from outside sources, such as sirens, traffic horns, etc.
* Avoid the rustling sound of paper or moving things around your desk.
* Install noise-canceling software to filter out any background noise.

![eliminate background noise](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/zoom-podcasts-recording-3.jpg)

##### Step4 Set Up Separate Audio Tracks for Each Speaker

Wouldn't it be easier to edit your podcast if you recorded audio tracks for each speaker separately? Zoom has this feature of recording separate audio tracks.

To enable this, go to your zoom 'Settings' and click on the 'Recording' setting. Then select "Record a separate audio file for each participant," and you are ready to go.

##### Step5 Brief Your Guest About Zoom Functioning Before You Begin

If you are going live and your guest is new to zoom, it is better that you guide him briefly about the functioning of zoom. Guide your guest on how to join the call using zoom. It would be best if you also told him about the duration and topic of your podcast.

It is advised to test the microphone and headphones of your guest before starting a live podcast. Your guest does not need to download and install zoom on their device; he can join by clicking the link and entering the call from his browser.

![brief the guest about zoom functioning](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/zoom-podcasts-recording-5.jpg)

##### Step6 Record the Call Using Zoom

It is pretty simple to record a podcast using zoom. Here are the steps you need to follow:

1. Click on the 'New Meeting' button to initiate the call.
2. Now click on the 'Invite' button.
3. Select 'Copy Invitation' and copy the ID and password of your meeting
4. Share the ID and passcode with your guest.
5. Ask your guest to join the call by clicking on the link.
6. After your guest joins the call, press 'Manage Participants' at the bottom of the screen.
7. You will see a list of all the participants. Please make sure everyone's microphone is working and their voices are clear.
8. Click on the participant name you want to make a co-host and press the make co-host button.
9. Click the 'Record' button and turn on 'Original Sound' to start recording the podcast.
10. When the podcast is complete, click on the 'End' button and then click on 'End Meeting for All.'

![record the call using zoom](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/zoom-podcasts-recording-6.jpg)

##### Step7 Edit the Audio File Using Editing Tools

At the end of the recording session, you will get two different file types. An MP4 audio file that you can edit using audio editors and an MP4 video file that you can edit and post on youtube or any other social media platform.

If you have recorded separate audio tracks for each speaker, you will get separate MP4 audio files for each speaker with that person's name. You can edit the audio tracks with professional podcast editing software, like Audacity editor or Filmora.

## Limitations of Using Zoom for Podcasts

Having discussed the method to record podcasts with zoom and the benefits of using zoom, we will now discuss the limitations of zoom for podcast recording. Of course, every software has its limits, and so does zoom, and these limitations are discussed below.

### ‚óè Audio and Video Quality

 Zoom's priority is virtual conferencing, which compromises audio and video quality to optimize the speed and smoothness of calling. Besides, the recording audio and video quality depend upon your internet speed. If your internet is slow, you will experience lag and interruptions in your recorded podcasts.

### ‚óè Compressed Audio and Video

Zoom compresses your audio and video files by removing portions of audio tracks making the file smaller. Audio compression makes your video chat smooth, but the resulting recorded file is of low quality for professional use.

### ‚óè Time limit

With the free plan, you can make calls for a maximum of 40 minutes. To record longer podcasts, you must spend money on the paid version.

## Tips to Elevate Your Podcast With Zoom

* Ensure you and your guest have a strong and stable internet connection.
* Give your guest a brief tutorial on zoom before going live.
* Use a high-quality podcast microphone for better audio quality.
* Make sure your environment is quiet, and there is no background noise.
* Use your device's built-in video recorder to record a backup podcast. It will be helpful if your internet lags and in case you somehow lose the zoom recording.

Because of its limitations, zoom cannot be used as a professional podcast recording tool. So we need an alternative to zoom to record podcasts for professional purposes, and here Wondershare Filmora comes into play.

### 1\. Can you record a podcast virtually?
