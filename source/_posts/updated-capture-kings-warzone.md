## Capture Kings Warzone

When it comes to live streaming on video platforms like YouTube or Twitch from your desktop, you will need a live streaming software. Among live video streaming software, OBS Studio and Streamlabs Desktop clearly stand out. They are popular because they are completely free to use and they have all the necessary features a video streamer desire.

Not just live streaming on any online platform, they software applications also let you record your live streams, record your computer screen as well as webcam. Now the question arises whether to choose Streamlabs or OBS Studio. We will help you out in your decision making by providing a thorough comparison of OBS vs Streamlabs parameter by parameter.

## 1\. About OBS Studio

Here are all the details of OBS Studio that you will help you compare OBS with Streamlabs.

![obs pros and cons](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-pros-and-cons.jpg)

Performance:

OBS Studio is designed for multi-tasking. You can live stream as well as record your video. You can capture your screen as well as webcam video simultaneously. In fact, it supports capturing video from various external devices. For regular video recording and streaming, the performance of OBS is top-notch. It does not affect the performance of your streaming or gameplay.

However, when you have extremely high-quality video playing on your screen or you are playing high-end games that you want to record, OBS Studio tends to consume excessive CPU resources. Therefore, OBS Studio is suitable for regular quality streaming and recording and it might crash if your computer configuration is not top-notch.

Recording:

If you are comparing OBS vs Streamlabs for recording, OBS is a clear winner. This is because OBS Studio heavily focuses on recording features while Streamlabs focuses on live streaming broadly. You can record video from any external device, you can modify recording quality, and you can switch between multiple scenes as required. It also comes with filters for color correction, chroma key, and masking for better recording.

Streaming:

OBS Studio is the most popular live streaming platform and this is due to its wide compatibility. Once you have Stream URL and Stream key, you can literally stream on any and all online platforms that allow live streaming. Starting from Twitch, YouTube and Facebook to even Instagram and Twitter, you can stream on all popular and not-so-popular platforms directly from your desktop.

Ease Of Use:

OBS can be a bit complicated to use for beginners. This is because the user interface is not as clean and intuitive as you would expect. However, once you start using the software for some time, you will get used to the controls and options. But the learning curve is rather steep and that is why many users opt for OBS alternatives. For ease of use, OBS Studio has loads of hotkeys through which you can perform all the different operations instantly.

Video Quality:

OBS Studio lets you customize the video quality as per your requirements. You can capture 4K video depending on your screen resolution or camera resolution. However, OBS automatically lowers the frame rate as the resolution of the video goes up which is not desirable. That is why users do not prefer OBS for recording 4K videos and mostly use it for standard, high-definition video quality.

### Pros

* Compatible with Windows, Linux, and MacOS.
* Wide range of compatibility for live streaming.
* Customizable settings from different specifications.
* Work with multiple scenes and input sources.
* Pushes latest updates for improved performance.

### Cons
