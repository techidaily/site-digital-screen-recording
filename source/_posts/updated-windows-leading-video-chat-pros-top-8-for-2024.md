### 3\. [Wire](https://wire.com/en/)

The online platform Wire is one of the best video calling apps for pcs. It takes a different approach from our list's other video calling apps.

The wire is, in effect, the best video calling app for pcs with Windows 10 if you want to be sure nobody can trace or watch your calls.

Wire’s Main Features

Some of the features that make Wire such a fantastic video calling app for pc (Windows 10) are:

### 4\. [Zalo](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/zalo-desktop/9nlspxn6g2jl?activetab=pivot:overviewtab)

Zalo has almost the same attention to privacy as Wire, but it is marketed at a much younger age bracket. This is probably your friends' messaging service if you have all the latest social media apps on your phone. Zalo is the best video calling app for PC that will let you call while you stream or game.

Zalo’s Main Features

Some of the Features that make Zalo a great video calling app for PC include:

The one that everyone knows by name (and by far the most popular video calling app for PCs) is Skype.

* Skype credit allows you to call mobile phones from your PC.
