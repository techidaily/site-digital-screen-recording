One such program is [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) by Wondershare. Although Wondershare Filmora is primarily used for industry-standard post-product tasks such as video editing, apply effects and filters to the motion clips, etc., it offers the option to [record computer screen](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), webcam, and audio as additional features so you don’t have to depend on any other software for screencasting.
