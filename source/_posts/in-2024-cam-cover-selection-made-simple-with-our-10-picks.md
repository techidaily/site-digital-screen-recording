The online privacy concerns are growing day by day as people are facing so many threats in routine. Hackers are too active to gain access to one’s system and take a second to destroy important data with malware and viruses. Reports reveal that many **online hackers are stealing personal information via webcams.** Since people have now become aware of the fact that webcams can be used for hacking, most of them are using black tapes to block webcams when they are not in use.
