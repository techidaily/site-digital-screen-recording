## Part 1\. How Can You Do Screen Recording on iPad？

iOS devices work differently. Like iPhones, the iPad also lets you do screen recording, but there is definitely some specific procedure that you should follow. Let us introduce the steps to you that you should follow in recording fun stuff, cool gaming videos, and other kinds of tutorials with an iPad.

### Enable Screen Recording Settings

The screen recording process for iPad starts with enabling the Screen recording feature from the Settings. You can never record anything on iOS devices until the feature has been enabled. Follow the steps shared below to get this done.

Step 1: Firstly, move to the Settings app and then look for the 'Control Center' option. Tap on the 'Customize Controls' option from the Control Center screen. Hit on it.

Step 2: Now, from the 'Customize' section, locate 'Screen Recording.' If it has a green plus sign next to it, then it means that it is not enabled. Hit the plus sign to enable it, but if it has a red minus sign next to it, that means it is already enabled.
