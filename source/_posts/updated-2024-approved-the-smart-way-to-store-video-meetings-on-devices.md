In order to record a Teams meeting, you:

* Must be a meeting organizer
* Must be using Office 365 Enterprise with an E1, E3, E5, F3, A1, A3, A5, M365 Business, Business Essentials, or Business Premium license
* Must have the recording feature turned on by the IT administrator of the organization
* Must not be a guest or attendee from another organization

### 1\. Record Teams Meeting on Desktop/Laptop

Once you are sure that all the prerequisites that are listed above are met, you can go through the following instructions to learn **how to record a Teams meeting** on a computer:

**Step 1: Start a Teams Video Call**

Launch Microsoft Teams on your PC (a Windows 10 laptop here). On the main interface, make sure that the **Chat** option is selected in the pane on the left. Then, click **Video** **Call** (the **Camcorder** icon) from the top-right area of the **Chat** pane.

**Step 2: Start the Recording**

During an ongoing meeting session, click the **More actions** icon from the top-right area of the **Meeting with** box, and click **Start recording** from the menu that comes down next to start the recording.

**Step 3: Stop the Recording**

Once the meeting session is over, you can open the **More actions** menu again, and click **Stop recording** this time to stop the recording.

### 2\. Record Teams Video Meeting on Smartphones

There are a couple of things that you must ensure before a Teams meeting can be recorded on smartphones. The list is given below:

* The correct licenses for Office 365 Enterprise as listed earlier
* The IT administrator has NOT disabled the recording feature
* The Teams data is NOT set to be stored in-country
* You are using the latest version of Teams
* The recording is NOT set in any private team channel

Once all the requirements listed above are met, you can safely continue with the following methods to learn **how to record a Teams meeting** on a smartphone.

## Part 2: How to Automatically Record Microsoft Teams Meetings?

Quite recently, Microsoft integrated a new feature to the Teams app that allows the organizers to automatically record all the meeting sessions that take place.

You can learn **how to record a Teams meeting** automatically by following the instructions that are given below:

**Step 1: Get to the Meeting with Box**

When on the **Meeting with** box, click **Join now** to start a new meeting, click the **Show participants** icon from the upper-right area, and when the **Participants** box comes up, click **Manage permissions**.

**Step 3: Enable Automatic Recording**

On the **Meeting options** page, turn on the **Record automatically** switch. Once this is done, you can safely share the invitation link with the people you want to attend the meeting, and Teams will start the recording as soon as the first participant joins in.

One such program is [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) by Wondershare.
