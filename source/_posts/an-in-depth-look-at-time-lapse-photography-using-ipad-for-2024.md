Apple claims that iPad can record 30 hours of time-lapse video. You have to consider the battery charge and the storage space on your iPad. These important factors can limit the recording duration of your time-lapse video. The longer the duration of the time-lapse, the lower will be the frame rate.

**How do you time a video on iPad?**

You cannot set a fixed time duration for capturing a video on iPad. You have to manually start and stop recording a video on iPad. However, you can always trim the video duration as per your requirements. You can use iMovie app to trim the video duration and time your video accordingly.
