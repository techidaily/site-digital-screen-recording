There is no doubt that playing VR games is more fun on gaming consoles than on computers. When you are playing VR games with your VR headset, it feels more natural to play the game from a gaming console rather than playing from a keyboard. If you use PlayStation 4 as your VR console, you can use the built-in recording option on PS4 to record virtual reality gameplay. Here are the steps you need to follow minutely.
