 Google Duo is one of the most straightforward tools that Google has to offer to its users. It is a high-quality video calling app that enables smooth video-calling experience. Moreover, its simplicity, reliability, and versatility makes it a favorite among users. The Google Duo works perfectly on smartphones, Google Nest, tablets, as well as on computers and laptops.

**Features**:

* Group calling

 It is difficult to stay in contact with more than one or two people at the same time. However, it is no longer a problem with Google Duo. Now you can connect with quite a few people at the same time. To be precise, Duo supports a maximum of eight people in a group call. So, chatting with friends, families, and colleagues has now become easier.

* Calls between iOS and Android

 You can stay connected with people irrespective of the device you are using. It is because you can install Google Duo on your tablet, phones, or even chat via the web.

* Low light mode

 The small light mode feature helps you to enjoy the best video calling experience, even when there is less light. For example, if you are trying to chat with people during the evening or nighttime, this is effective.

* Video Messaging

 Suppose you are busy at the moment, and cannot accept a video call request. Just send a custom message along with fun effects through the video messaging tool.

* Voice Calling

 There are times when a video call is not possible. Don’t worry because Google Duo also supports voice-only calls.
