![Filmora Text Effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/setup-camera.jpg)

Filmora Scrn is perfectly equipped for recording all types of PIP videos that need to capture desktop activities while also **recording the footage from a webcam**. YouTubers and all other users of this software can feature themselves in the video. Filmora Scrn lets you capture videos with **frame rates that go from 15 fps to 120 fps**, and it also enables users to **adjust the size of the screen** area they want to capture.

Recording voice-over during the recording session, adding markers, or using HotKeys to start or pause recording sessions are just a few among the many amazing features Filmora Scrn offers.

#### 3. Edit Video Footage with Creative Effects

![Filmora Scrn Annotations ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/annotation-filmora-scrn.jpg)

All files captured with the screen recorder are displayed in the software's video editor that allows you to trim or cut video clips, add captions, or use blending modes to merge the layers in your videos seamlessly.

The Annotations tab lets you add captions, overlays, speech bubbles, and, most importantly, blur effects. The **Mosaic, Linear, Vertical, Horizontal** **, Horizontal Mix, and Vertical Mix** **blur** options are available to users who want to protect sensitive info in their screen recordings. Let's have a look at how you can protect the privacy of the information in your screen recordings by blurring them in Filmora Scrn.

![Filmora Scrn Blur Effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/blur-effects-filmora-scrn.jpg)

There are two extraordinary blur effects we must mention here, one is called Horizontal Mix, and the other is Vertical Mix. Words cannot express how amazing it is; let me show you some examples.

The original frame is shown below, and I want to blur and hide these two sensitive pictures (in red mark).

![Filmora Scrn Blur Effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/blur-effects-examples.jpg)

After I applied the Horizontal Mix blur and the Vertical Mix blur to these two pictures, below is what I got:

![Filmora Scrn Blur Effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/blur-mix-effects-filmora-scrn.jpg)

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-rose-win.png)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[![Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-rose-mac.png)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

See, these two "private" pictures are hidden as if nothing were here. Do not believe the miracles? Why not follow the steps below to check it by yourself?

## Part 2: How to Blur and Hide Private Information with Filmora Scrn

Hiding the identity of the people in your videos and concealing private information like bank account or telephone numbers is advised if you want to avoid any chance of misuse of these data.

#### Step 1. Record a video or import a video file into the editor

![Filmora Scrn Annotations ](<https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/blurring-private> info-import.jpg)

If you choose to capture a screen with the Filmora Scrn's screen recorder, the video file you create will be automatically imported into the software's video editor and placed into the Media Bin after the recording session is over.

Filmora Scrn's video editor supports most video file formats, including AVI, MP4, or MOV files. If you want to add blur effects to videos that weren't captured with Filmora Scrn, click on the Add Files icon in the editor's Media Bin, find the video file you'd like to work on and click Open. The file you imported will be displayed in the Media Bin, so to start editing it, drag and drop it to the timeline.

#### Step 2. Applying the Blur Effects

After you've placed a video clip on the timeline, you should click on the **Annotations** icon next to the Media icon on the left side of the screen. Select the Blur option from the drop-down menu and proceed to select the blur effect you'd like to add to your video.

Drag the effect you like the most to the timeline or drag it to the Canvas directly, and adjust its duration by removing the effect's end to the right.

#### Step 3. Tweaking the Effect's Settings

![Filmora Scrn   ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adjust-blur-effects.jpg)

On the right side of the editor's screen, you'll be able to see Transform and Blur options. Use the Transform feature to place the blur effect over the area of the shot in which the sensitive info is located to hide it from the spectators. Alternatively, you can move or resize the blurred window by dragging it on the software's preview screen.

Next to the Transform icon, you'll be able to see the Annotations icon, click on it and proceed to adjust the blur Intensity and Opacity features. You should repeat this process as many times as necessary until all the sensitive information in your video clip is blurred.

#### Step 4. Export the Video

Finally, you can go ahead and click on the Export button if you're happy with the results you achieved. Filmora Scrn lets you export your video files directly to YouTube, Vimeo, or Twitch, while you can also save your video clip to your hard drive in MP4, MOV, GIF, or MP3 file formats.

Ok, that's it. Hope you have hidden and blurred the private info in your recorded video. Leave a comment below and let us know if it works for you perfectly.

On the right side of the editor's screen, you'll be able to see Transform and Blur options. Use the Transform feature to place the blur effect over the area of the shot in which the sensitive info is located to hide it from the spectators. Alternatively, you can move or resize the blurred window by dragging it on the software's preview screen.

Next to the Transform icon, you'll be able to see the Annotations icon, click on it and proceed to adjust the blur Intensity and Opacity features. You should repeat this process as many times as necessary until all the sensitive information in your video clip is blurred.

#### Step 4. Export the Video

Finally, you can go ahead and click on the Export button if you're happy with the results you achieved. Filmora Scrn lets you export your video files directly to YouTube, Vimeo, or Twitch, while you can also save your video clip to your hard drive in MP4, MOV, GIF, or MP3 file formats.

Ok, that's it. Hope you have hidden and blurred the private info in your recorded video. Leave a comment below and let us know if it works for you perfectly.
