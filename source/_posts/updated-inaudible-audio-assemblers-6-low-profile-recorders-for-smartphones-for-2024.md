The world has moved on from a secret voice recording device to a secret voice recording app. This is because we have our smartphones with us all the time.

Instead, you need a secret voice recording app that can record in the background when the display is off. You can also record voice calls with such a voice recorder app without the other person getting any alert. We have compiled the list of best secret voice recorder apps for Android and iOS.
