### 3\. [Wire](https://wire.com/en/)

The online platform Wire is one of the best video calling apps for pcs. It takes a different approach from our list's other video calling apps.

Wire’s Main Features

Some of the features that make Wire such a fantastic video calling app for pc (Windows 10) are:

Zalo is the best video calling app for PC that will let you call while you stream or game.

Zalo’s Main Features

### 5\. [Skype](https://www.skype.com/en/)

The one that everyone knows by name (and by far the most popular video calling app for PCs) is Skype. It has tons of great features but grew to success in the days when calling was still expensive and video calling was almost unheard of. Skype made waves in the market by being one of the first services to do it all for free.
