Logitech’s 4K Pro camera shows just how far webcams have come. The 4K Pro is the first mass-market 4K webcam in the world. It is also loaded with extra features to produce beautiful videos, far surpassing the needs of most users. Although Skype and Messenger users might not find the 4K Pro cost-effective ($199!) tech enthusiasts and pro-streamers will. Because what the 4K Pro offers is a glimpse into the 4K future!

In this article we will provide a comprehensive review of this Logitech 4K webcam, breaking it down to the essentials, so you can decide if this is the gadget for your YouTube streaming or video recordings.

![ Logitech 4K Webcam ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/logitech-4k-pro-webcam.jpg)

## Part 1: Logitech’s 4K Pro camera Hardware Specification

The Logitech 4K Pro features **4K Ultra HD streaming up to 4096 x 2160 pixels at 30 FPS**. It also streams 1080p Full HD at either 30 FPS or 60 FPs and 720p HD at 30, 60 and 90 FPS. This range of options is essential because, without a monitor that supports 4K Ultra HD, you won’t be able to use the 4K Pro’s 4K capabilities. **Logitech’s RightLight 3 with HDR** further enhances the video, allowing for streaming in various lighting environments ranging from direct sunlight to low-light.

It also has **plug-and-play capabilities**, with USB 2.0 Type A and USB 3.0 Type A and C connectivity. It has the best out-of-the-box settings we’ve seen in a webcam. However, to get the most out the 4K Pro you need to **download the Logitech Camera Settings app from Logitech’s website**. The app makes available all the 4K Pro’s camera controls such as pan and 5x digital zoom in Full HD as well as the ability to calibrate brightness, contrast and white balance. It also lets you choose between standard and widescreen displays or change the field of view (FOV) from 90 degrees to 78 or 65 degrees.

The Logitech also has a **[Background Replacement Feature](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**, enabled through a separate download, and **built-in dual omnidirectional mics with automatic background noise cancellation**.

The camera’s system requirements are Windows 7 (1080p only), Windows 8.1, Windows 10 and masOS 10.10 or higher. For Chromebooks, it requires Version 29.0.1547.70, Platform 4319.79.0 with a 2.4 GHz Intel Core 2 Dual Processor and 2 GB of RAM.

## Part 2: Compact Design

The 4K Pro manages to fit all those features into a slim design. **It’s just** **4 x 1.1 x 1.1-inches**. Because of its aluminium casing, it is also light, weighing just two ounces. The 4K Pro’s layout is simple, with the 4K lens in the centre between the two omnidirectional, noise-cancelling microphones.

The unit is mounted to a rubber-coated flexible arm that can clip onto the top of a laptop or flat-screen monitor. The rubber arm allows the camera to be tilted and contorted for greater customisation. **Unfortunately, the 4K Pro’s mount is a step-down in build quality from the C920 and C922**. Logitech’s webcams usually have some of the best clips in the business, because they are made of hard plastic that locks them tight against your screen. The 4K Pro’s arm takes a little getting used to and it can wobble and even fall off if you’re not careful. However, I can understand why Logitech made the change. The 4K Pro’s arm is detachable and reveals a square plastic piece on the bottom of the stand which folds out, allowing the camera to stand freely on any flat surface. Alternatively, the stand can be removed to place the camera on a tripod mount.

**The 4K Pros 4.9-feet cable is also detachable**, so you can replace it with a more compatible connector of your choosing. There are two accessories included with the 4K Pro. A plastic privacy shutter that clips over the camera unit with a small-hinged flap that can be lowered over the lens when you’re not using it. As well as a microfiber drawstring bag to transport the 4K Pro in.

## Part 3: How is the Picture and Sound Quality recorded by Logitech 4K Webcam?

**There’s no question Logitech’s 4K Pro takes the best-looking pictures out of all the external webcams on the market**. Its unparalleled quality is enhanced by Logitech’s RightLight 3 with HDR technology, allowing it to adjust to all lighting environments; whether it be under fluorescent lighting or natural light. Recordings are wide-screen, with real-to-life colours and sharp details. **Thanks to the wide 90-degree lens, it also captures more of the background then its competitors**. However, as mentioned in the specifications section, you have to download the Logitech Camera Settings App to unlock all the 4K Pro’s features.

**The dual omnidirectional microphones produce crystal clear sound**. The automatic background noise-cancellation worked well in all environments and the recorded audio was nice and loud.

## Part 4: How effective are the main features of the 4K Webcam?

As mentioned in the specifications section, there's an optional Background Replacement Feature, which is powered by Personify. The feature is in its beta stage, which is why it’s not built into the app. Instead, you need to download an extra driver to get it to work. **But despite being in beta, the Background Replacement Feature works really, really well**.

There's a cool new feature, which I have not seen on other webcams, that blurs the background to keep out the details you might want to keep hidden! The Chromakey pre-set green-screen background is **great for game streaming on Twitch or YouTube**.

**The 4K Pro also uses an infrared camera to support facial recognition to log in via Windows Hello**. This is such a cutting-edge and exciting feature and it worked well regardless of the lighting environment.

Also, once you have downloaded the Logitech Camera Settings App it is very easy to customise your videos. The multiple field-of-vision options and 5x digital zoom allow you to take control of the shot and are fantastic integrations for video-conferencing.

## Part 5: How About the 4K Webcam Recording Capabilities?

**Right now, there aren't many ways you can use the Logitech 4K Pro at its full 4K resolution.** The issue is that 4K Ultra HD has yet to make the kind of impact in the online market that it has in home entertainment. The most popular video-chatting apps, including Google Hangouts and Skype for Business, don’t support 4K. **You’ll also need a [4k Monitor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to truly appreciate the picture** and if who you’re chatting to online doesn’t have one, then they’ll only see you in 1080p. You can stream 4K videos to YouTube if you have enough bandwidth. Besides the 4K monitors, you may also need a [webcam recorder](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) that has the ability to [record 4K videos](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) too, such as Filmora [Screen Recorder Software](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

**The RightLight 3 with HDR functionality does mean that you will get the sharpest, most accurate videos out there**. But until the software and hardware that support 4K are widely available the ultra-high-resolution aspect of the camera will not be immediately useful.

Therefore, you should get the Logitech 44K Pro takes the best shots you’ll get right now if you can put-up with the mount which is a huge step down from previous models. But right now, there’s limited usability for such a futuristic webcam and Logitech makes cheaper alternatives that can shoot HD videos, such as the C920 and the C922.K Pro Webcam if you're a YouTuber who wants to live stream super-sharp videos at the highest resolution possible. Or, if you’re a forward-thinking type and have the budget to get ahead of the curve.

It also has **plug-and-play capabilities**, with USB 2.0 Type A and USB 3.0 Type A and C connectivity. It has the best out-of-the-box settings we’ve seen in a webcam. However, to get the most out the 4K Pro you need to **download the Logitech Camera Settings app from Logitech’s website**. The app makes available all the 4K Pro’s camera controls such as pan and 5x digital zoom in Full HD as well as the ability to calibrate brightness, contrast and white balance. It also lets you choose between standard and widescreen displays or change the field of view (FOV) from 90 degrees to 78 or 65 degrees.

The Logitech also has a **[Background Replacement Feature](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**, enabled through a separate download, and **built-in dual omnidirectional mics with automatic background noise cancellation**.

The camera’s system requirements are Windows 7 (1080p only), Windows 8.1, Windows 10 and masOS 10.10 or higher. For Chromebooks, it requires Version 29.0.1547.70, Platform 4319.79.0 with a 2.4 GHz Intel Core 2 Dual Processor and 2 GB of RAM.

## Part 2: Compact Design

The 4K Pro manages to fit all those features into a slim design. **It’s just** **4 x 1.1 x 1.1-inches**. Because of its aluminium casing, it is also light, weighing just two ounces. The 4K Pro’s layout is simple, with the 4K lens in the centre between the two omnidirectional, noise-cancelling microphones.

The unit is mounted to a rubber-coated flexible arm that can clip onto the top of a laptop or flat-screen monitor. The rubber arm allows the camera to be tilted and contorted for greater customisation. **Unfortunately, the 4K Pro’s mount is a step-down in build quality from the C920 and C922**. Logitech’s webcams usually have some of the best clips in the business, because they are made of hard plastic that locks them tight against your screen. The 4K Pro’s arm takes a little getting used to and it can wobble and even fall off if you’re not careful. However, I can understand why Logitech made the change. The 4K Pro’s arm is detachable and reveals a square plastic piece on the bottom of the stand which folds out, allowing the camera to stand freely on any flat surface. Alternatively, the stand can be removed to place the camera on a tripod mount.

**The 4K Pros 4.9-feet cable is also detachable**, so you can replace it with a more compatible connector of your choosing. There are two accessories included with the 4K Pro. A plastic privacy shutter that clips over the camera unit with a small-hinged flap that can be lowered over the lens when you’re not using it. As well as a microfiber drawstring bag to transport the 4K Pro in.

## Part 3: How is the Picture and Sound Quality recorded by Logitech 4K Webcam?

**There’s no question Logitech’s 4K Pro takes the best-looking pictures out of all the external webcams on the market**. Its unparalleled quality is enhanced by Logitech’s RightLight 3 with HDR technology, allowing it to adjust to all lighting environments; whether it be under fluorescent lighting or natural light. Recordings are wide-screen, with real-to-life colours and sharp details. **Thanks to the wide 90-degree lens, it also captures more of the background then its competitors**. However, as mentioned in the specifications section, you have to download the Logitech Camera Settings App to unlock all the 4K Pro’s features.

**The dual omnidirectional microphones produce crystal clear sound**. The automatic background noise-cancellation worked well in all environments and the recorded audio was nice and loud.

## Part 4: How effective are the main features of the 4K Webcam?

As mentioned in the specifications section, there's an optional Background Replacement Feature, which is powered by Personify. The feature is in its beta stage, which is why it’s not built into the app. Instead, you need to download an extra driver to get it to work. **But despite being in beta, the Background Replacement Feature works really, really well**.

There's a cool new feature, which I have not seen on other webcams, that blurs the background to keep out the details you might want to keep hidden! The Chromakey pre-set green-screen background is **great for game streaming on Twitch or YouTube**.

**The 4K Pro also uses an infrared camera to support facial recognition to log in via Windows Hello**. This is such a cutting-edge and exciting feature and it worked well regardless of the lighting environment.

Also, once you have downloaded the Logitech Camera Settings App it is very easy to customise your videos. The multiple field-of-vision options and 5x digital zoom allow you to take control of the shot and are fantastic integrations for video-conferencing.

## Part 5: How About the 4K Webcam Recording Capabilities?

**Right now, there aren't many ways you can use the Logitech 4K Pro at its full 4K resolution.** The issue is that 4K Ultra HD has yet to make the kind of impact in the online market that it has in home entertainment. The most popular video-chatting apps, including Google Hangouts and Skype for Business, don’t support 4K. **You’ll also need a [4k Monitor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to truly appreciate the picture** and if who you’re chatting to online doesn’t have one, then they’ll only see you in 1080p. You can stream 4K videos to YouTube if you have enough bandwidth. Besides the 4K monitors, you may also need a [webcam recorder](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) that has the ability to [record 4K videos](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) too, such as Filmora [Screen Recorder Software](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

**The RightLight 3 with HDR functionality does mean that you will get the sharpest, most accurate videos out there**. But until the software and hardware that support 4K are widely available the ultra-high-resolution aspect of the camera will not be immediately useful.

Therefore, you should get the Logitech 44K Pro takes the best shots you’ll get right now if you can put-up with the mount which is a huge step down from previous models. But right now, there’s limited usability for such a futuristic webcam and Logitech makes cheaper alternatives that can shoot HD videos, such as the C920 and the C922.K Pro Webcam if you're a YouTuber who wants to live stream super-sharp videos at the highest resolution possible. Or, if you’re a forward-thinking type and have the budget to get ahead of the curve.
