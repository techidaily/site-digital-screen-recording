## Essential Methodologies in Capturing Web Radio Audio

If you are a music and podcast lover, it is very likely that you often listen to streaming songs and podcasts online. There are surely going to be times when you wish you could download the streaming audio and save it on your hard drive for listening to them anytime offline. Instead of playing a music video online and wasting your internet data, you can just record the audio part from the video and listen to it offline. In fact, you may want to record online live streams of podcasts before they disappear forever. That is where an online stream recorder can come in handy.

Most streaming platforms do not have a download option for copyright reasons and for retaining online users. You can record streaming audio online from any audio and even video playing online. You can listen to the recordings repeatedly without consuming internet data. You can share them directly with others instead of sharing the link. You can even trim parts and use them in your videos.
