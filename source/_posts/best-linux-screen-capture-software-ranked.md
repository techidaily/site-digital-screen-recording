Though there are many screen capture tools for Linux available on the market, to make things easier, consider the top 8 screen capture tools for Linux mentioned below. They are all excellent when it comes to user-friendliness, allowing you to take screenshots or record screens in a snap.

Some of these tools are only used to capture screenshots and edit the captured images, while some also allow you to capture the whole activity on your screen, namely, [record whatever happening on your Linux screen](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Hope it is helpful for you to find the best screen capture tool based on your needs.

#### 6. [ScreenStudio](http://screenstudio.crombz.com/)
