## FAQs

**How can I use the PS2 Emulator for Android to play PS2 games?**

Unless you have the ISO file plus the PS2 BIOS file, the best ps2 emulator android games won't work. Using Google, you may quickly find the ISO file for a given game. The "Unknown sources" tab in your phone's settings should be enabled. Apps from unknown sources may now be installed. This is good news.

You'll need to have a PlayStation 2 BIOS in order to run certain emulators like DamonPS2 Pro, for example. On Google, you may also download this file and put it into the app's folder.
