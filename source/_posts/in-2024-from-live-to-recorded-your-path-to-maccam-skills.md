## From Live to Recorded: Your Path to MacCam Skills

In this article, I'll show you how to record your webcam on a Mac using various screen recorders. MacBook has been widely used for quite some time, and it has not only maintained its competitive edge over the years, but has also modernized and improved its services. Apple's operating system also has a built-in video recorder called as QuickTime player. It can also be used for capture and video recording, but it lacks the productivity and customization capabilities of the other tools in this article. The video from the webcam can be fetched along with the option to record a specific part of the screen.

The main aim is to bring to your knowledge the best tool to record from your MacBook’s webcam and modify and alter it to produce the best results possible. Now there are many famous tools such as Filmora, OBS, QuickTime player, Camtasia etc. So I will be listing down their pros and cons for you to decide which one works best for you. They are all great applications but as everyone has a different perspective so there is no such thing as favorite. I am to start with the tool I feel most comfortable with and in my opinion it is the best screen recorder in the market i-e Filmora

* Used to capture desktop.
* Has tools for editing video and audio.
* Can be used for live streaming and video conferencing.
* Surprisingly, has a very wide range of tools/functions to modify your videos and audio.
* It has the ability to enhance the audio and video content.

**Cons:**

* Free software, so cannot complain, but sometimes is a little bit slow.
* Lacking a few tools compared to other recorders.

To conclude my article I would say that there are many excellent video recorders available in the market each one with its own unique set of tools and beautiful layouts to enamor and entice the user to explore its imagination. All these tools are brilliant to use, both with windows and mac devices. And which one to install? Can only be answered by the user. Because depending on the nature of the project or a perspective any of these applications can be the best tool for the video recording.
