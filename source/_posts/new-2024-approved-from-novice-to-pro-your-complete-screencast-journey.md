## Part 2\. Key Features of Screencast-O-Matic Screen Recorder

Here are the key features of Screencast-O-Matic that make it stand out among its competitors.

Screen and Webcam – You can capture your screen as well as your webcam video individually as well as simultaneously. Besides, you can capture system as well as external mic audio narration.

Customization – You can customize the screen size as per your requirements. You can also capture the active window of the currently running application as well as full screen for recording gameplay.

Real-Time Drawing – You can use the drawing tools in real-time while recording to highlight any portion of the screen as well as erase your drawings instantly. Among drawing tools, you get pen, brush, eraser, and outline tools. You can also insert texts wherever required.

Zoom Effect – One of the unique features of Screencast-O-Matic is that it lets you zoom any portion of the screen for better viewing while recording. This is very useful while making tutorial videos where you focus on specific options and zoom in on the options.

Edit Videos – Editing the recorded video is as important as recording the video. You can trim unnecessary parts, add stock music, add captions, as well as highlight cursor movements with the inbuilt video editor. The premium version has options for green screen effect, adding overlays, mixing recordings, removing silences, blurring sensitive information, and much more.

Screenshot and GIFs – If you opt for the premium version of Screencast-O-Matic, you take screenshots while recording as well as create GIFs from your recorded video. There is also an automated speech-to-text captioning option available.

Besides, you can upload the recorded video to YouTube, Google Drive, and Dropbox. You can save the video on your hard drive in MP4 file format.

## Part 3\. Plans and Prices

Here are the limitations of the free Screencast-O-Matic download web launcher.

* Maximum recording time of 15 minutes
* Adds a watermark to record video
* Cannot record system audio
* Cannot capture screenshots and create GIFs
* No automated speech-to-text captioning option
* Very limited editing options

Hence, the free version of Screencast-O-Matic is more like a demo version. You need to have the premium version to record video without any recording limitation and any watermark. Here are the plans and prices you can choose from.

1\. Solo Deluxe - $4.00 per month: You get all the features of the screen recorder without any limitation. But you get limited stock library.

2\. Solo Premier - $5.75 per month: You get all features without any limitation. Additionally, you get unlimited stock library, online video backup, video hosting, and privacy controls.

3\. Business Team - $5 per month for 3 users: You get all the features on Solo Deluxe and Premier. Additionally, you get to collaborate with team members, get advanced admin panel to manage user roles and manage content as well as get different integrations.

## Part 4\. Alternative Way To Record Screen Videos

There are several limitations of premium Screencast-O-Matic as well. You always need an active internet connection to record your screen. The file format for saving the video is limited to MP4 only. The useful editing options are still limited in comparison to a professional video editor. That is why there are many who look for a better alternative to Screencast-O-Matic screen recorder. We recommend Wondershare Filmora which is a premium [video recorder](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) with inbuilt video editor.

In comparison to Screencast-O-Matic, Filmora has more options for better screen and webcam recording. It lets you save the recorded video in different file formats.
