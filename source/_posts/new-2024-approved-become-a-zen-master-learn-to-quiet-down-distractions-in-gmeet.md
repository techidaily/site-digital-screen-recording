**Google meet mute** is a highly effective feature available to the participants in a meeting. Sometimes there may be distortion in the background, so individuals can mute their mic to avoid any disturbance in the meeting. It is possible for the host to mute an attendee in the meeting, or themselves as well. While the person is muted, they can still listen to what is being discussed in the meeting, but other members will not be able to listen to them until they are unmuted.

## Part 1: How Does the Mute Button in Google Meet Work?

The mute button in Google Meet is like a blessing in disguise, with just one click you can silence your mic. This way the participant can still hear what is going on in the session, but they are not audible to anyone else. So, if for instance, you are only a listener in the session and do not want to contribute, then you can mute your microphone.

Additionally, if an individual wants to participate in a meeting, they can unmute their microphone and then quickly mute it again once they have contributed. With just one click, the host of the meeting can also mute everyone in the session so there are no extra sounds or distractions.

## Part 1: How Does the Mute Button in Google Meet Work?

The mute button in Google Meet is like a blessing in disguise, with just one click you can silence your mic. This way the participant can still hear what is going on in the session, but they are not audible to anyone else. So, if for instance, you are only a listener in the session and do not want to contribute, then you can mute your microphone.

Additionally, if an individual wants to participate in a meeting, they can unmute their microphone and then quickly mute it again once they have contributed. With just one click, the host of the meeting can also mute everyone in the session so there are no extra sounds or distractions.

## Part 2: How to Mute Your Microphone in Google Meet?

While many believe using the mute feature on Google Meet is a tricky task, the question of **how to mute a Google Meet** is fairly simple.

### 2\. How to Remove A Participant from Google Meet Without Being A Host

If you are not the host, then regretfully, you can not remove a certain participant from the meeting. However, if you download an extension, that might do the trick to enable this feature.

#### FAQs about Muting People on Google Meet

**Q1) Will people know if I mute myself on Google Meet?**

Yes, people will definitely know that you have muted yourself, as your microphone will appear on the screens of other participants with a canceled sign on it.

**Q2) What To Do If You Have Been Muted in Google Meet?**

If you get muted by someone else in the session, then you can unmute yourself by clicking on the microphone icon at the bottom of your meeting window or press “\*6” keys to unmute yourself.

#### Are you Ready to Use the Mute Function on Google Meet?

The mute feature on Google Meet is truly very simplistic and handy to use. All one has to do is click a few buttons and they are good to go! Follow the process mentioned above, and you will have the easiest time making use of the Google Meet mute feature.
