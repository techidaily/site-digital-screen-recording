## Part 1: How to Download and Set up Snap Camera with Google Meet?

The first thing you’ll need to do is download and install the Snap Camera. It’s a very easy process. Visit the [Snap Camera website](https://snapcamera.snapchat.com/) and click the Download button to start. Please note you’ll need a Windows 10 (64 bit) or newer; or a macOS 10.13 or newer to be able to download and install the Snap Camera.

Once downloaded, find the file on your desktop and double click to install. On the mac, you’ll need to drag the icon to the applications file (when you click the downloaded file it usually automatically shows you what to do).

Open the snap camera and you’ll be able to see your face on the screen. That’s it, you’ve downloaded the Snap Camera. Select the preferred filters and lens from the below list and check the result in the video stream window. Now onto the next step, which is configuring the Snap Camera to work with Google Meet.

## Part 2: How to Use Snap Camera on Google Meet?

There are two different ways of using the snap camera on Google Meet - the first method is to log in via Gmail and the second is to access Google Meet directly from the website.

**Method 1: Gmail login**

**Step 1:** Log in to your Gmail account and on the left-hand side of your Gmail landing page, you will see two options under Meet: New meeting and Join a meeting.

![Google Meet  Options](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gmail-meet-options.jpg)

**Step 3:** Select “New Meeting” and then choose to send an invitation link or start right now. Here, let’s click on Start now and a Google Meet pop-up will tell you what the default video source is.

![Google Meeting ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-meet-interface.jpg)

**Step 4:** Click on the three dots on the preview screen and click on settings.

**Step 5:** Inside the settings option, switch to the Video option and then you will see the first option that you get is “Camera”.

![Set Snap Camera as Google Meet Camera ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-meet-video-camera-settings.jpg)

**Step 6:** Click on the options under the camera selection and select the Snap Camera.

**Step 7:** Set the resolution to 720p or whatever the highest option is for the sending resolution and the receiving resolution accordingly.

That’s it! Now you’ll be able to use Snap Camera for your Google Meet communications! Let’s look at the other way of logging in to Google Meet: directly from the website.

**Method 2: Access Google Meet from the Website**

**Step 1:** Open the [Google Meet website](https://meet.google.com/).

**Step 2:** If you are logged in, you’ll be able to see the homepage which shows two options: New meeting, which allows you to create a new meeting , or join an existing one which says enter a code or link. So, to create a new meeting, click on “New meeting”, and then select Start an instant meeting to create. You can also create a meeting for later or schedule a meeting in Google Calendar. If you don’t see these two options, log in first, and then you’ll be able to access the two buttons.

* _Inside the settings option, Select the Settings button from the_ menu, _open the Video tab by clicking on Video. As soon as you do this, the first option that you get is “Camera”._

## Part 3: How to Use Snap Cam with Google Meet using Third-Party Inputs

It is also possible to use Google Meet and Snap Camera with third-party inputs such as the Canon EOS webcam utility or other applications such as IRUin camera of Epoc Cam. Here is how:

**Step 1:** Open the Snap camera app and find the default camera input that it shows you.

**Step 2:** Find the Gear icon on the top right of the screen and click on it to open the Snap Camera settings.

**Step 3:** Inside the Snap Camera settings, you will be able to see the “Choose Your Camera” option, which should be the first option available. Just below, find the drop-down menu with all the available camera inputs.

**Step 4:** Select your desired camera input and change it to that. You’ll now be able to use ut with Snap Camera.

To use third-party inputs like Iruin webcam, Epic cam, or Canon Webcam Utility, you’ll need to select the Snap Cam as the input in the meet settings. Your input will be passed through Snap Cam via webcam utility or another application using your phone or your DSLR, then passed through to Google Meet. You’ll be able to use the filters with far better resolution on Google Meet.

## Part 4: How to Add Filters to Google Meet Without Snap Camera on Mobile

Currently, Snap Camera is available for Windows and Mac computers, which means you can’t install it on your iPhone or Android phone. If you want to add filters to Google Meet on mobile, you can follow the steps below to use the on-platform integrated filters:

**Step 1:** Open Google Meet on your [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.meetings&hl=fr&gl=US) device or [iPhone](https://apps.apple.com/fr/app/google-meet/id1013231476).

**Step 2:** Follow the usual steps: start a meeting or join an existing one.

**Step 3:** As soon as you access your meeting, tap on the “Effects” icon situated near the bottom of your face on the screen.

**Step 4:** You’ll be able to access different options under the Effects icon, such as Blur, Backgrounds, Style. At the very end, you’ll find “Filters”.

**Step 5:** Tap on the filters option and see all the filters available. Choose any filter you want, and it will be automatically added to your video input.

## Part 5: Google Meet Adds Video Filters and AR Stickers for Personal Call

Google Meet recently added new filters, effects, and AR (augmented reality) masks for calls on iOS and Android. On July 7th, Google tweeted that the new features would be available: “cats, astronauts, jellyfish and more”... Sounds exciting! Here’s how to add them to your Google Meet calls.

![ Google Meet AR Stickers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-new-ar-stickers-news-on-twitter.jpg)

**Step 1:** If you haven’t yet, download Google Meet for Android or iOS and then open it.

**Step 2:** Select a meeting to enter - you can either open a new one or join an existing one.

**Step 3:** Once you’ve entered the meeting, click the “Sparkle” icon at the bottom right of the video screen.

**Step 4:** Select the fun new video effect you’d like and it will automatically add to your video input screen, AKA to your face.

**Video Calls can be Fun!**

As you can see, there are many different ways of implementing filters into your Google Meet video communications, to make your calls a little less boring. You can use these filters on your computer, whether it be a Windows or Mac device, by downloading Snap Camera; or you can use the Google Meet app to use the brand new filters Google has introduced. Don’t let physical distance be an obstacle to having fun with your loved ones - the infinite possibilities of filters on Google Meet will assure lots of laughs!

Select the preferred filters and lens from the below list and check the result in the video stream window. Now onto the next step, which is configuring the Snap Camera to work with Google Meet.

## Part 2: How to Use Snap Camera on Google Meet?

There are two different ways of using the snap camera on Google Meet - the first method is to log in via Gmail and the second is to access Google Meet directly from the website.

**Method 1: Gmail login**

**Step 1:** Log in to your Gmail account and on the left-hand side of your Gmail landing page, you will see two options under Meet: New meeting and Join a meeting.

**Step 4:** Click on the three dots on the preview screen and click on settings.

**Step 6:** Click on the options under the camera selection and select the Snap Camera.

**Step 7:** Set the resolution to 720p or whatever the highest option is for the sending resolution and the receiving resolution accordingly.

That’s it! Now you’ll be able to use Snap Camera for your Google Meet communications! Let’s look at the other way of logging in to Google Meet: directly from the website.

**Method 2: Access Google Meet from the Website**

**Step 1:** Open the [Google Meet website](https://meet.google.com/).

**Step 2:** If you are logged in, you’ll be able to see the homepage which shows two options: New meeting, which allows you to create a new meeting , or join an existing one which says enter a code or link. So, to create a new meeting, click on “New meeting”, and then select Start an instant meeting to create. You can also create a meeting for later or schedule a meeting in Google Calendar. If you don’t see these two options, log in first, and then you’ll be able to access the two buttons.

* _Float your mouse over the bottom of the window to make the menu appear (find the microphone, hang up, and camera button), then click the three dotes positioned on the far right of the screen._
* _Inside the settings option, Select the Settings button from the_ menu, _open the Video tab by clicking on Video. As soon as you do this, the first option that you get is “Camera”._
* _Click on the options under the camera selection and select the Snap Camera._
* _Set the resolution to 720p or whatever the highest option is._

**Step 1:** Open the Snap camera app and find the default camera input that it shows you.

**Step 3:** Inside the Snap Camera settings, you will be able to see the “Choose Your Camera” option, which should be the first option available. Just below, find the drop-down menu with all the available camera inputs.

**Step 4:** Select your desired camera input and change it to that. You’ll now be able to use ut with Snap Camera.

To use third-party inputs like Iruin webcam, Epic cam, or Canon Webcam Utility, you’ll need to select the Snap Cam as the input in the meet settings. Your input will be passed through Snap Cam via webcam utility or another application using your phone or your DSLR, then passed through to Google Meet. You’ll be able to use the filters with far better resolution on Google Meet.

## Part 4: How to Add Filters to Google Meet Without Snap Camera on Mobile

Currently, Snap Camera is available for Windows and Mac computers, which means you can’t install it on your iPhone or Android phone. If you want to add filters to Google Meet on mobile, you can follow the steps below to use the on-platform integrated filters:

**Step 1:** Open Google Meet on your [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.meetings&hl=fr&gl=US) device or [iPhone](https://apps.apple.com/fr/app/google-meet/id1013231476).

**Step 2:** Follow the usual steps: start a meeting or join an existing one.

**Step 3:** As soon as you access your meeting, tap on the “Effects” icon situated near the bottom of your face on the screen.

**Step 4:** You’ll be able to access different options under the Effects icon, such as Blur, Backgrounds, Style. At the very end, you’ll find “Filters”.

**Step 5:** Tap on the filters option and see all the filters available. Choose any filter you want, and it will be automatically added to your video input.

## Part 5: Google Meet Adds Video Filters and AR Stickers for Personal Call

**Step 2:** Select a meeting to enter - you can either open a new one or join an existing one.

**Step 3:** Once you’ve entered the meeting, click the “Sparkle” icon at the bottom right of the video screen.

**Step 4:** Select the fun new video effect you’d like and it will automatically add to your video input screen, AKA to your face.

**Video Calls can be Fun!**

You can use these filters on your computer, whether it be a Windows or Mac device, by downloading Snap Camera; or you can use the Google Meet app to use the brand new filters Google has introduced.
