## **Part 1: What to Consider Before Blurring the Background in Zoom?**

Zoom can blur everything in the screen’s background with the tap of a button, which can save you from uploading an image to hide your screen’s background. Here's how to get started before you learn how to blur the background in Zoom.

#### 1 – Here to look for the blue background on Zoom

Primarily, make sure that you are looking at your laptop's Zoom Client. First, open Zoom; tap the **Settings** icon at the top right corner. From there, select "**Backgrounds and Filters**” in the sidebar popup. Then, follow our step-by-step guide to blur Zoom background from there.

#### 2 – Update Zoom to get the Blur Background

Ensure that the computer system is up to date and supports the latest version of Zoom. To check for updates, tap your profile picture of your **Zoom Desktop Client** at the top-right corner, then scroll down and tap where it says "**Check for Updates**."

If you've already downloaded the latest version, restart your computer and open Zoom again to see if it shows up.

#### 3 – Check Your Computer Requirements

Alternatively, you can check for Client and processor requirements. All the information related to requirements compatibility is available on the Zoom help page for virtual background requirements.

To check the compatibility, go to "**Backgrounds and Filters**" and uncheck the box that says "**I have a green screen**" under "**Virtual Backgrounds**."

Next, hover over your list of virtual backgrounds. In case you get an error message pointing you need a green screen to support virtual backgrounds, your computer doesn't support the blur background feature.
