After you click on the Create button, a new window will appear on the screen. In the upper left corner of the window, you'll be able to see Screen Area and Application options.

The Audio feature lets you record both narration and system audio.

#### Step 3 - Starting a new video recording session

When the new window opens, click on the Browse icon next to the Working Folder feature, and select insert the new destination folder for your video. Above the Working Folder option is the Show Mouse in Video Demo Mode checkbox, make sure it is marked if you want the mouse cursor to be visible in the video and click OK to confirm the changes you've made.

Hit the Record button to initiate the video recording session. You can hit the Esc or End buttons to stop recording if you are using a PC, while Mac users can perform the same action by hitting Cmd + Enter keys.

#### Step 4 - Publish the video

Upon the completion of the video recording session, the Publish Video Demo window will appear on the screen. You'll be able to save your video as an MP4 file directly to your computer, or you can export the video directly to YouTube, Facebook or Twitter.
