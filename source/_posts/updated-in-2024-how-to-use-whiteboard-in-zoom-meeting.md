## Part 3: How to Use Whiteboard During Zoom Cloud Meeting on iOS

 Along with Android, Zoom is available for iOS devices as well. However, at the time of this writing, the Whiteboard feature can only be used on iPads. So, if you’re running Zoom Cloud Meeting on your iPhone, you won’t see the Whiteboard option. Nevertheless, the interface and the options that the Zoom’s iOS variant has are almost identical, and so is the process of sharing **Zoom meeting whiteboard** .

 You can learn how to use **Zoom whiteboard**  on an iPad by following the instructions explained below:

#### Step 1: Share Whiteboard on iPad

 On your iPad, use the regular method to start a new meeting and invite the participants to join the conference, tap **Share Content**  from the meeting control panel at the top, and tap **Whiteboard**  from the menu that appears.

#### Step 2: Access Annotation Tools

 Tap the **Edit**  ( **Pencil** ) icon from the bottom-left corner to expand **Zoom annotation tools** , tap your preferred icon to add annotations to the whiteboard, and tap **Stop Share**  once you are done drawing.

**Note:**  Process of doing other things including clearing your annotations or ending the meeting remains the same for both Android and iOS platforms.

### Frequently Asked Questions About Zoom Whiteboard

#### 1\. Can we share multiple whiteboards in a meeting?

 Yes. Other participants of a meeting can share their whiteboard with you as well. In order to do this, you must configure Zoom by clicking the small arrow available next to the **Screen Share**  icon, and clicking the **Multiple participants can share simultaneously**  option from the menu.

#### 2\. Why can’t I see the Annotation tools?

 If you have joined a meeting hosted by someone else, it is possible that the host has prohibited other participants from annotating. In this case, you can request the host to enable annotations for the other members.

#### 3\. How to collaborate on a whiteboard in Zoom?

 If you are a participant in a Zoom conference that has been hosted by another person, collaborating on a shared whiteboard requires you to enter the full-screen mode by clicking the **Full Screen**  button at the top-right corner, clicking and opening the **Options**  menu from the top or bottom (depending on your operating system), clicking **Annotate** , and then continuing with the regular annotation process.

**Note:**  To be able to collaborate on a whiteboard, it is important that the host of the meeting has allowed the members to add annotations.

**Conclusion**

**Zoom whiteboard**  allows you to share your ideas with other participants of the conference. The good thing is, while using a desktop version, you can allow participants to share their whiteboard. You can also allow or prohibit them from annotating on the whiteboard that share. About the mobile versions, Zoom is available for both Android and iOS platforms. However, the latter variant of the app can be installed only on iPad. All in all, Zoom is available for Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, and iOS devices where all the variants of the program share almost identical interface and therefore can be used seamlessly throughout.
