## Part 1\. How to Rotate Video in VLC on Windows

There are various reasons why you may want to rotate a video. It could be that the video has been taken at the wrong angle or you want to watch the video at a certain angle from a different perspective.

Here are the steps to perform VLC rotate video.

Step 1: Open VLC Media Player.

Step 2: Go to Media > Open File option and select the video file that you want to rotate.

Step 3: Once the video opens, go to Tools > Effects and Filters option.

In order to disable this rotation effect, follow the same steps and this time, uncheck Transform and Rotate options.

## Part 2\. How to Rotate Video in VLC on Mac

The process of VLC Media Player rotate video is slightly different on Mac as compared to Windows. Here are the steps to follow to rotate video on VLC temporarily.

Step 1: Open VLC Media Player. Go to File > Open File option to open the video file that you want to rotate.

Step 2: Once you have opened the file, go to Window menu option.

Step 3: From the menu, select Video Effects option.

![vlc rotation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlc-rotation-options.jpg)

The options available are - rotate by 90 degrees, 180 degrees, and 270 degrees. Besides, you can flip horizontally or vertically.

Step 6: Once done, just close Video Effects window and the changes will get saved automatically.

If you want VLC rotate video and save feature so that the video’s rotation angle changes permanently, take the following steps on Windows.

Step 1: Open VLC player and open the video file.

Step 2: Follow all the steps we have mentioned on Method 1 - How to rotate video in VLC on Windows?

Step 3: Thereafter, go to Tool menu and select Preferences option.
