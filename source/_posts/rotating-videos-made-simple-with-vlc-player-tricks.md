Here are the steps to perform VLC rotate video.

Step 5: Under Video Effects tab, go to Geometry tab.

But note that this VLC rotate effect will stay with VLC and if you open any other video file, it will also be displayed as per your selected angle. In order to disable this rotation effect, follow the same steps and this time, uncheck Transform and Rotate options.
