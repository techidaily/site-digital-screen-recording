## Are You Ready to Change Backgrounds on Google Meet?

The process of changing backgrounds on Google Meet is not complicated at all. All you need to do is follow the steps mentioned above and you can change your background to whatever you please. Whether it is a work meeting or a fun video call with your colleagues - you can adjust your background accordingly to create a better setting for yourself and eliminate all extra elements from your background.

If you have [recorded the Google Meet video](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), and want to change the video background, then you should try Wondershare Filmora. The Human Segmentation effect under AI Portrait will isolate the people from the video background, and [remove the background even without a green screen](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), and later you can add a new video background.

Check the video tutorial below to find out more details, and download to try Wondershare Filmora for free.
