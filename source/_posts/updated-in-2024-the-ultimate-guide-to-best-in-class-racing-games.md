## The Ultimate Guide to Best-in-Class Racing Games

If you go back in time, about a decade ago, there was a decline in the acceptance of sim racing games. A number of great development studios were closing, and even mainstream series like Need for Speed struggled to maintain their original popularity.

If you are a racing fan, then there is good news for you. Things are a lot better today as compared to the past. Several racing titles have been introduced over the years, like Forza Horizon, Assetto Corsa, iRacing, etc. We have seen several open-world racing games getting immense popularity among gamers. The simulation racing genre is more competitive than ever today. In July 2015, EA acquired Codemasters for a staggering $1.2 billion, illustrating how highly racing games have been valued for the last few years.

This article will present our top picks of the best sim racing games you can play right now. Most of these games are modern because this genre is continuously improving. But, we won't be skipping those classic titles that are still popular among gamers and as good as modern ones. Our primary focus here will be to cover those games that are easy to find and play on the majority of the hardware. So without wasting any time, let's get to our main topic.

## THE BEST SIM RACING GAMES

### 1.Dirt Rally 2.0

**Platforms:** PC, PS4, Xbox One

![dirt-rally-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/dirt-rally-poster.jpg)

If you are looking for the best off-road racing simulation gamers, then dirt rally 2.0 stands on the top of the list. There has probably never been anything better. Despite its unbalanced package, this car offers outstanding handling and a driving experience as gripping as anything else in this class. The best way to experience it is with a good wheel, but it's unbeatable for communicating the pure thrill of a car and the challenge of a course.

**Features:**

* In terms of career mode, both rallycross and rally mode is available.
* You can play Freeplay to compete for titles, create your own custom game, and run-time trials across all tracks.
* In addition to joining the team, players can increase the ability of team members.
* Overall it offers a great gameplay experience which is worth all the effort.

### 2.iRacing

**Platforms:** PC

![iracing-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iracing-poster.jpg)

The eSports industry is well known for three things: its costs, time commitment, and toughness. In addition to that, it encapsulates some of the most exciting aspects of motorsport. As you work your way through the ranks, you will experience the same camaraderie and excitement as the real deal - and, yes, crushing disappointment too. It's undeniable that some aspects of Iracing are becoming a bit stale - and there are certainly more realistic-looking sims out there - but with ten years of experience comes a level of competency you won't find anywhere else.

**Features:**

* The technology and features it offers are superior to those of its competitors.
* The tracks are very authentic, realistic, and accurate.
* A huge selection of cars is available. Players can find their dream cars in this game.
* The sim racing experience that it offers is unmatchable to any other game.

### 3.Assetto Corsa / Assetto Corsa Competizione

**Platforms**: PC, PS4, Xbox One

![assetto-corse-competizione-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/assetto-corse-competizione-poster.jpg)

The two experiences offered by Kunos Simulazioni are so different, yet both so good, that we've included them both. Assetto Corsa has seen better days, but it can still be an awesome driving sim with a few mods, and Competizione is getting better as it reaches iRacing as a pure racing sim. As far as GT racing is concerned, it is probably the healthiest and most diverse form of motorsports right now.

Assetto Corsa also has a number of useful force feedback options that will let you experience driving a car without having to feel it. You are likely to have the most difficulty getting used to a PC when you start. In reality, you'll need to step it up when it's time to get real.

**Features:**

* The career mode provides a very real experience where you progress as a racer and earn titles and rewards.
* The advanced physics engine makes it the next-generation simulation game.
* Although the car selection is not so wide, if you don't mind playing with mods, you won't get bored with this game.
* The best thing about this game is that you can play it using any kind of device like a keyboard, controller, joystick, etc.
* It provides the best hardware compatibility.

### 4.Project Cars 2

**Platforms:** PC, PS4, Xbox One

![project-cars-2-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/project-cars-2-poster.png)

Project Cars 2 is likewise available on modern consoles, so you can also expect polish and presentation, including an offline career mode that is light but solid. Cars and tracks are abundant here, especially if you purchase the season pass along with numerous car packs.

Physicists have made these improvements to accommodate the physics engine, like in Assetto Corsa. Driving a car is fun because they are responsive and fun, but I always have difficulties connecting with them. The wide range of vehicles here, from two-stroke karts to four-wheel-drive rally vehicles, makes it all feel the same, which is a problem.

**Features:**

* The physics is much better than the competition.
* Classic and new cars are available.
* Race tracks of even better quality.
* Track and weather conditions that are dynamic.
* The difficulty level can be adjusted very easily.
* The PC version of this game has amazing VR.

### 5.rFactor 2

**Platforms:** PC, PS4, Xbox One

![rfactor2-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/rfactor2-poster.png)

We go way, way back with rFactor. Its core physics engine was used to power older iconic games, like F1 Challenge 2002\. Ad-hoc online leagues and modified mods were my only choice back then. The list of licensed cars and tracks in rFactor 2 is now extensive (and is still growing), and it even includes some of the most competitive online racing series around.

RFactor 2 is the one game that gets seriously out of everything I've listed so far. The game doesn't come with a half-dozen offline career modes or a complex licensing system that unlocks cars. There's a menu where you choose where to race, which car to drive, and then you're off. Offline racing is certainly possible, and the artificially intelligent competition will provide a good challenge, but the most frightful competition is usually to be found online -- including the likes of Max Verstappen.

**Features:**

* The physics of this game is the most complex among all sim racing games.
* The handling of cars is way better.
* Different weather and day and night conditions of the game make it much more appealing.
* You can choose from some really high-quality mods with great mod support.

## Conclusion

Sim racing is one of the most favorite sub-genre of racing lovers. So, we have presented you with a list of some of the best sim racing games that are available in the market right now. All these games work on almost the same physics. The only difference is between graphics, cars, maps, tracks, mods, and other technicalities. All games have their own pros and cons. Some offer the fastest cars while others offer better handling. It all comes down to user choice and preferences. If you are new to the sim racing environment, you can try all these titles and then decide which one suits you the best.
