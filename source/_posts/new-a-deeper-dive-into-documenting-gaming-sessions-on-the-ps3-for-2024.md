## Way 2\. Record PS3 Games with Capture Card

Since PS3 does not have any means to record gameplay into the gaming console, you have to connect your gaming console to computer for recording. However, you cannot connect a gaming console directly to your computer for playing games and recording them. You need to buy a capture card to connect your gaming console to computer. The most popular capture card is Elgato Game Capture HD. You can record PS3 gameplay at a very high quality and here are the steps to follow.

Step 1: Connect PS3, capture card and computer via HDMI cable.

Step 2: Connect your PS3 to your TV and the USB cable from the capture card should go to your computer.

Step 3: Turn on PS3 and go to Settings to make sure PS3 software is updated so that there is no issue in connectivity with capture card and computer.

Step 4: On your computer, configure the capture card and you must be seeing the same gameplay that you are seeing on your TV. To record the gameplay, you can use any online screen recorder or the inbuilt screen recorder of your capture card.
