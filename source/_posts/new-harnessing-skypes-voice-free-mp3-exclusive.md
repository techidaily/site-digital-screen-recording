**Step 1**: Make sure the **ON** button is pressed and its green to start automatic recordings.

**Step 3**: As the process is automatic, whenever a call is detected mp3 skype recorder will start on its own and a small indication will be displayed when the recording is started. If you don’t need this alert then you need to buy the pro edition of mp3 skype recorder.

**Step 4**: To check if the recorder is working fine, you can check the recording status on the bottom bar of the recorder window. You will see that the current mp3 size is changing consistently and that indicates that the recorder is getting sound that is being encoded into a file.
