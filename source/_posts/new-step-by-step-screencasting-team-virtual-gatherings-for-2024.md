You can learn **how to record a Teams meeting** automatically by following the instructions that are given below:

**Step 2: Get to the Meeting options Page**

When on the **Meeting with** box, click **Join now** to start a new meeting, click the **Show participants** icon from the upper-right area, and when the **Participants** box comes up, click **Manage permissions**.

**Step 3: Enable Automatic Recording**

On the **Meeting options** page, turn on the **Record automatically** switch. Once this is done, you can safely share the invitation link with the people you want to attend the meeting, and Teams will start the recording as soon as the first participant joins in.

**Step 4: Stop the Recording and Export**

Once the meeting session is over, press **F9**, or right-click the **Screen Recorder** icon from the notification area, click **Open recorder**, and then click the **Stop** button from the panel that appears next to stop the recording.

Now, you can drag the recorded footage from the **Media** box to the Filmora timeline at the bottom to start editing the clip, and then can click **EXPORT** from the top of the interface to save the final version of the video that can be shared on your preferred platform or with your colleagues, team members, managers, etc.
