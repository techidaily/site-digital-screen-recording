## Part 1: How Does the Mute Button in Google Meet Work?

This way the participant can still hear what is going on in the session, but they are not audible to anyone else. So, if for instance, you are only a listener in the session and do not want to contribute, then you can mute your microphone.

Additionally, if an individual wants to participate in a meeting, they can unmute their microphone and then quickly mute it again once they have contributed. With just one click, the host of the meeting can also mute everyone in the session so there are no extra sounds or distractions.

Click onto a participant’s picture and click Mute or if this step is not working for you, then at the bottom right of your video room on Google Meet, click people , once you do that a menu will appear on the side of your screen.

Yes, people will definitely know that you have muted yourself, as your microphone will appear on the screens of other participants with a canceled sign on it.

**Q2) What To Do If You Have Been Muted in Google Meet?**

If you get muted by someone else in the session, then you can unmute yourself by clicking on the microphone icon at the bottom of your meeting window or press “\*6” keys to unmute yourself.

#### Are you Ready to Use the Mute Function on Google Meet?

The mute feature on Google Meet is truly very simplistic and handy to use. All one has to do is click a few buttons and they are good to go! Follow the process mentioned above, and you will have the easiest time making use of the Google Meet mute feature.
