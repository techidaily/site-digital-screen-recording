## The Quintessential Selection: 5 Must-Have Mac Snipers

Screenshots have become so ubiquitous that we don't pay much attention to them anymore. Yet, we use them day-in and day-out to show, explain, and communicate. Screenshots help us enrich and liven up our daily communication, whether it's sharing an image of a software bug with customer support, sending a quick how-to GIF to a colleague, or writing a heartfelt joke to a loved one.

Many Mac users need a widely-rated, multi-use MacBook snipping tool. All Mac users should know how to use the snipping tools, especially sales representatives and customer service representatives who use screenshots for product demos and troubleshooting. The simplest way to share your screen on Mac is by taking a screenshot.

The process of capturing and editing images and videos on a Mac is seamless that even the least tech-savvy user will find it easy to use.

There are several ways to capture your screen with Snagit. An entire screen can be captured, a specific area, or a specific application. Scanners and cameras can also be used to import images. An awesome feature of this snipping tool for Mac is the possibility of capturing text from a photo and pasting it into a text editor.
