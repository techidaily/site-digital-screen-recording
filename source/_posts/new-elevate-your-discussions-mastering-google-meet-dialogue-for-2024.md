## Part 1: How to Chat in Google Meet on a Desktop Computer?

There are times when individuals have something very essential to share with the participants in the meeting, however, it just is not their turn to talk. During times such as these, the Google Meet chat feature can come in very handy!

While using a laptop or desktop computer, using the chat feature is very easy. All you have to do is just simply join the meeting that you are supposed to.

Once you have joined the session, look towards the bottom right-hand side of your screen. Over there you will see numerous options, but do not get confused. Make your way over to the speech bubble sign, and click on that, as shown in the image below.

![ Google Meet Chat Option  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-meet-chat-options.jpg)

Upon clicking the speech bubble, a chat window will open on the right-hand side of your screen. On the bottom of the window, there will be a blank text box.

![ Google Meet in-call message  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-meet-in-call-message-window.jpg)

Click on the blank text box and type the message that you would like to share.

![ Google Meet chat message  window](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/type-texts-google-meet-chat.jpg)

After typing the message, in order to send it to all the participants in the meeting, click the send button. Another way of sending the message is simply by pressing the “Enter” key on your keyboard.

As soon as you press the arrow, your message will be visible to all the members available in the meeting at that point in time.

## Part 2: How to Chat in Google Meet Mobile App?

Don’t have your laptop on you and you need to attend a Google Meet conference and use the chat feature? Well, you can easily use the chat feature on your mobile device as well!

The first thing is first, join a Google Meet conference on your Google Meet mobile app. For this, you must either create a new meeting or join the session using a meeting link.

After you have joined the meeting, tap on the further options button located at the bottom of your screen. This is the button that has three dots on it.

![ Google Meet chat mobile button](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-meet-mobile-more-options-button.jpg)

When you press the further options button on Google Meet, more options will show up regarding subtitles, adding new participants to the meeting, and more. From all of these many options, you must select the “in-call messages” option, to enable private chatting on Google Meet.

![ Google Meet in-call message button](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-meet-mobile-in-call-messge-chat.jpg)

After you click the option, your screen will show a text box pop-up on your entire screen. This is where you will type out a message or paste a link that you would like to share with other members of the Google Meet conference. Once you have typed a write up of the message that you would like to convey in the meeting, simply press send.

![ Google Meet sent chat message mobile](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/send-google-meet-chat-message-mobile.jpg)

After you click send, the message/messages will be shared with all other participants in the meeting. Keep in mind you cannot delete messages on Google Meet, so send messages wisely. By using the chat feature individuals can get their message across to all the members in the meeting without disrupting the entire meeting itself. There is no need to unmute your microphone to communicate when you have the chat feature available to you as well.

## Part 3: How to Create a Group Chat on Google Meet?

While there is no way to create a group chat on Google Meet directly, what individuals can do is create a hangout and then turn on videos. This way people of a certain group can video call as well as chat simultaneously.

For this to work, first, go to Gmail and create a hangout group. To create a hangout group, locate the “Hangout” bar and click the “Addition” icon, located near the bottom left side of your screen.

After doing that, paste the email address of the participant that you would like to invite and add them to the hangout.

![ create group chat on Google Meet  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-group-chat-google-meet-hangouts.jpg)

Following that, send them a hangouts link and enable video.

Once that is done individuals can now chat and video conference at the same time.

## Part 4: How to Create a Private Chat on Google Meet?

Many individuals wonder if they can privately chat on Google Meet, however that option is not possible in the Google Meet chat feature till now. Any and all messages or links that individuals share during a conference on Google Meet are shared with all the participants who are in the meeting during that time.

For instance, if a participant leaves a meeting and you send a message when they have left, then that participant joins again, the participant will not be able to receive or view your message. However, all those present in the session while the message was sent can read it. There is no option to create a private chat on Google Meet as of now.

## Part 5: How to Change Google Meet Chat Font Size?

Google Meet comes fully equipped with numerous features and functions, however, changing the chat font size is not one of them. Participants cannot make any changes to the font of messages sent in the chatbox. They cannot increase the size, spacing, font style, or color of the messages that are being sent. While these options are available in other Google Application features such as Gmail and more. They are still yet to come into play on Google Meet.

## Part 6: How to Add Emojis to Google Meet Chat?

Want to make your messages on Google Meet slightly quirky or funny, why not add an emoji to spice things up! Emojis are the perfect way to grab attention to pressing messages, which individuals might overlook otherwise. You may have noticed that the Google Meet chat feature does not have an emoji button visible to you, however, you can still send emojis on Google Meet.

Simply join the meeting that you would like to become a part of.

Once you have joined the Google Meet session, make your way over to the bottom right side of your screen and locate the speech bubble icon and click that.

![ Google Meet chat option ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-meet-chat-options.jpg)

After clicking on the speech bubble icon, a messaging window will open on the right side of your screen.

From there go over to the messaging text box and right-click on your computer device for an additional options menu. No matter which device you are using, the first option in the additional menu will be that of emoticons and symbols.

![ Google Meet emoji and symbols option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-meet-emoji-symbols-option.jpg)

Click the emoji and symbols option and a popup of all the emojis available on your device will appear on the screen, as shown in the image below.
