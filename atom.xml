Within a PC, the system may be utilized to create professional-looking films. Camera video recording is supported by EaseUS RecExperts, allowing users to shoot movies inside the webcam or as an overlay, allowing for higher levels of involvement. You may record the whole screen, a specific region, or even a locked window with EaseUS RecExperts. Additionally, while recording, you may annotate your screen, label an area, and do other editing activities. You can rapidly export or distribute your recording to various platforms, depending on your preferences.</p><p>EaseUS RecExperts is a multi-purpose but simple-to-use Windows screen recorder that allows you to record and capture everything on your computer’s screen. Thanks to its simple and well-organized interface, you can get started quickly. You may record your screen, audio, and camera independently or all at once. In addition, the game recording option enables you to record your games in whatever way you desire. Annotation, cutting, watermark insertion, and other sophisticated editing tools are included in the program. The recordings may be exported in a variety of file formats, including MP4, AVI, and WMV. They may even upload the created video to YouTube immediately. Noise reduction and audio enhancement are also included in the software’s capabilities. It comes with its game recording mode, capable of capturing popular 2D&#x2F;3D games in 4K UHD quality. Users may use the built-in task planner to complete their recording tasks on time and in an automatic manner.</p><h2 id="1-Price-and-Tech-Specifications"><a href="#1-Price-and-Tech-Specifications" class="headerlink" title="1. Price and Tech Specifications"></a>1. Price and Tech Specifications</h2><p>EaseUS RecExperts cost $11.97 a month, $23.97 a year, or $69.95 for the rest of your life. A single license for one machine is included in this price. It’s worth noting that you can test out the program for free. The trial version restricts you to two-minute recordings and adds a watermark to your movies.</p><p>Windows 7, Windows 8.1, Windows 10, and Mac OS are all supported by EaseUS RecExperts. Initially, EaseUS Screen Recorder was only available for Windows, but a Mac OS version was eventually published. The program will be installed as a standalone app on your system disk. There are no further add-ons required. When recording games, RecExperts also allows you to alter the frame rate up to 60 frames per second. RecExperts is starting to look like a first-class application for all kinds of on-screen recording requirements, with the ability to output to 10+ commonly used recording formats (including MP4, MOV, and MP3), the ability to make GIFs directly from screen captures, and the ability to automatically stop and split recordings based on time or file size limits.</p><h2 id="2-How-to-Use-RecExperts"><a href="#2-How-to-Use-RecExperts" class="headerlink" title="2. How to Use RecExperts"></a>2. How to Use RecExperts</h2><p>EaseUS RecExperts is a premium screen recording software for Windows and Mac OS created by EaseUS.com. It’s a multi-purpose screen recorder that can do both screen recording and Webcam recording. RecExperts may also record full-screen or a specific part of the screen. The free trial version of RecExperts can be downloaded fast and conveniently from the EaseUS website, and the installation can be started right away.</p><p>Step 1: Launch EaseUS RecExperts</p><p>As can be seen in the screenshot below, the first function that is pre-selected for us when we launch the RecExperts program is the one that is necessary for capturing the complete default computer display. We have simple access to all of the software’s key functionalities as well as the main settings menu for modifying, among other things, the default file formats utilized, from this main program window.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/easeus-recexperts.jpg"                      alt="easeus recexperts"                ></p><p>Step 2: Setup the Recording</p><p>For improved content distribution, you may record the single Webcam or use the Webcam as an overlay on a movie. With simplicity, you may pick full-screen recording, a specific portion of the screen, or a single window. Simply pressing the orange “REC” button will start the recording process; the main program windows will vanish at this point, being replaced by a smaller control window, as seen below:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/1-setup-the-recording.jpg"                      alt="setup the recording"                ></p><p>Step 3: Finish&#x2F;Save Recording</p><p>We may finish the recording by clicking the red “stop” button after the screen recording is complete (which will, by default, include any sound outputted by the device during this process). When the recording is finished and the stop button is pushed, the RecExperts program will open the freshly recorded clip in the RecExperts editing suite, where we may continue to work with the material:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/save-recoring.jpg"                      alt="save recording"                ></p><h2 id="3-Pros-and-Cons"><a href="#3-Pros-and-Cons" class="headerlink" title="3.

Filmora, on the other hand, maybe of interest if you want additional bells and whistles. RecExperts Screen Recorder has compiled a list of reasons why you should look into screen recorder software. It is a useful screen recording app for Windows 10&#x2F;8.2.8&#x2F;7&#x2F;XP that allows you to capture any movement in any size. We can capture the screen using screen projection software, but it isn’t enough to generate a convincing movie or YouTube video instructive lesson. We’ll need video recording and editing software that can provide a clear screen recording for this. This is why we looked at Wondershare Filmora, a video recorder and editor available for both Windows and Mac OS.</p><p>Wondershare Filmora’s video recording and editing software comes with a comprehensive range of video capture and editing features, making it the finest alternative to RecExperts screen recorder software. Filmora allows you complete control over everything from the screen’s size to how you capture and edit video. Not only that, but it also allows you to upload media files, record the screen with sound, export movies to MP4, WMV, AVI, MOV, GIF, MP3, modify video effects, Bitrate, Frame rate, and change the sound when transmitting to the online community. This keeps your movie looking neat while keeping it interesting. You may generate a green screen effect, make adjustments, add stickers, subtitles, add comments, cursor effects, notes, callouts, trim video, denoise it, increment, fade-in&#x2F;fade-out volume, and much more after the screen is selected for recording and recorded.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><h3 id="Steps-to-Record-with-Filmora-3"><a href="#Steps-to-Record-with-Filmora-3" class="headerlink" title="**Steps to Record with Filmora:"></a>**<strong>Steps to Record with Filmora:</strong></h3><p>Step 1.

Because of its name, it may seem to be a complex program, although it is quite popular among Windows users. This utility is also compatible with games that use OpenGL or DirectX graphics. When it comes to FRAPS, many things raise the standard, but the competition it provides to its counterparts while remaining affordable is unrivaled. Older versions of Windows, such as Windows XP, are also supported by FRAPS. This function is exceptional since it is not available in any other screen recorder. It is, on the other hand, simple to use and has a fluid drag-and-drop feature that elevates it to the top of the hierarchy.</p><p>Fraps is one of the most well-known third-party programs for PC gamers, thanks to its free and simple benchmarking features that can test the performance of almost any game. It’s also a simple method to put a frame rate counter in the corner of your screen to keep an eye on in-game performance second by second. FRAPS can capture up to 7680 x 4800 at bespoke frame rates ranging from 1 to 120 frames per second, making it stand out among its peers. Skype calls from online or video games are among the features available. It can also record sounds through a microphone, making it the most versatile of all the options thus far. There is no way to capture webcam footage or create a timeline. It also can’t add video titles or capture audio from the system. None of these drawbacks, we believe, are relevant to video game recording fans. FRAPS has numerous drawbacks despite its low cost and flexibility.</p><h2 id="1-Download-and-Install"><a href="#1-Download-and-Install" class="headerlink" title="1. Download and Install"></a>1. Download and Install</h2><p>Fraps can also record videos of your gaming sessions, but unlike the other tools in our overview of gameplay capture software, you must pay to use the program’s full video recording features. Minimized start, always on top view, show status on LCD, minimize to system tray exclusively, and more options are available under Fraps’ general settings. Games that utilize OpenGL and DirectX technologies are compatible with the system.</p><p>DOWNLOAD LINK: <a class="link"   href="https://fraps.com/" >FRAPS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="2-How-to-Record-Screen-with-Fraps"><a href="#2-How-to-Record-Screen-with-Fraps" class="headerlink" title="2. How to Record Screen with Fraps"></a>2. How to Record Screen with Fraps</h2><p>**<strong>Step 1:</strong> When you first launch Fraps, you’ll see that there isn’t much to it. There are four tabs in this little window: General, FPS, Movies, and Screenshots.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/fraps.jpg"                      alt="fraps"                ></p><p>**<strong>Step 2:</strong> Fraps’ benchmarking tools are located under the FPS tab. When Fraps is active, the framerate counter is always visible in-game. If you want to record a benchmark while playing, just press F11, but first adjust the benchmarking parameters under FPS &gt; Benchmark Settings to your desire.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/fps.jpg"                      alt="fps"                ></p><p>**<strong>Step 3:</strong> Stop the recording, then go to the Movies tab to see how Fraps is recording your game. Some choices are accessible in the free version, while others are not. The loop buffer length is deactivated, which allows you to use the hotkey to record the latest “X” seconds of gameplay. You may, however, choose whether you want a full-size or half-size recording and select the maximum frame rate when recording. You may also change the sound capture settings, record your microphone, hide or show the mouse pointer, lock the framerate while recording, and capture lossless RGB.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/movies.jpg"                      alt="movies"                ></p><h2 id="3-Pros-and-Cons"><a href="#3-Pros-and-Cons" class="headerlink" title="3.

After a picture is acquired, the platform automatically names and timestamps it.

When using Frap Screen Recorder to record, the quality of the recording degrades by roughly 13%.

While Microsoft is still working to make the ‘Blur’ option enable for all the devices, no official statement from the organization has been released to date.</p><p>On the other hand, if your computer has AVX2 and you still cannot see the option, you can try a couple of things, and see if any of those works for you. For instance, you can:</p><ul><li>Sign out of Teams and then sign back in</li><li>Check for and update the webcam driver</li><li>Check for and install the most updated version of Microsoft Teams</li><li>Restart your computer</li></ul><p><strong>Q2) Can I blur the background in the Teams Business version?</strong></p><p><strong>A2)</strong> Yes, you can.

For instance, you can:</p><ul><li>Sign out of Teams and then sign back in</li><li>Check for and update the webcam driver</li><li>Check for and install the most updated version of Microsoft Teams</li><li>Restart your computer</li></ul><p><strong>Q2) Can I blur the background in the Teams Business version?</strong></p><p><strong>A2)</strong> Yes, you can.

The methods of getting this done on the laptop computers are explained below in detail.</p><p>The following sections explain <strong>how to blur the background on Teams</strong> both before and during a video call while working on a Windows laptop.

While Microsoft is still working to make the ‘Blur’ option enable for all the devices, no official statement from the organization has been released to date.</p><p>On the other hand, if your computer has AVX2 and you still cannot see the option, you can try a couple of things, and see if any of those works for you. For instance, you can:</p><ul><li>Sign out of Teams and then sign back in</li><li>Check for and update the webcam driver</li><li>Check for and install the most updated version of Microsoft Teams</li><li>Restart your computer</li></ul><p><strong>Q2) Can I blur the background in the Teams Business version?</strong></p><p><strong>A2)</strong> Yes, you can. Microsoft Teams (Free), Microsoft 365 Business Basic, and Microsoft 365 Business Standard versions allow you to blur the background with ease.

Chill, you don’t need a professional studio for this purpose. There is a lot of software, but zoom podcast recording is relatively more straightforward. A podcast is a collection of audio files that you can either download or listen to online using the internet. This article will help you learn to record podcasts using zoom.</p><h2 id="7-Step-Formula-How-To-Record-a-Podcast-on-Zoom"><a href="#7-Step-Formula-How-To-Record-a-Podcast-on-Zoom" class="headerlink" title="7-Step Formula: How To Record a Podcast on Zoom?"></a>7-Step Formula: How To Record a Podcast on Zoom?</h2><p>Recording a podcast on zoom is quite simple and easy. You don’t need to be a recording expert; you can get it done at home using your laptop. In this article, I will guide you on how to record a podcast using zoom step by step.</p><h5 id="Step1-Download-and-Install"><a href="#Step1-Download-and-Install" class="headerlink" title="Step1 Download and Install"></a>Step1 Download and Install</h5><p>The 1st step is downloading and installing zoom on your device. Next, create your zoom account by visiting the <a class="link"   href="https://soft-portal.shop/zoom/?url=https://zoom.us&id=5&geo=&ub=https://soft-portal.shop/zoom/&gclid=Cj0KCQjw48OaBhDWARIsAMd966AtsDXlasyuqO9r1vrbTzSdxKyOMLNsfNLa_RFZ12PRcu09P4sKnMcaAlUHEALw_wcB" >zoom website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Log in to this account with your installed software and enjoy zoom free. The free version allows you to record for 40 minutes. For longer calls, purchase the paid version.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/zoom-podcasts-recording-1.jpg"                      alt="download and install zoom"                ></p><h5 id="Step2-Setting-Up-Microphone-and-Headphones"><a href="#Step2-Setting-Up-Microphone-and-Headphones" class="headerlink" title="Step2 Setting Up Microphone and Headphones"></a>Step2 Setting Up Microphone and Headphones</h5><p>Zoom can use your device’s built-in microphone, but it is advised to use a high-quality external mic. It enhances the quality of your podcast tremendously. Plenty of external mics are available for under 50$, which can make a real difference.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/zoom-podcasts-recording-2.jpg"                      alt="set up microphone and headphones"                ></p><h5 id="Step3-Eliminate-Any-Background-Noise"><a href="#Step3-Eliminate-Any-Background-Noise" class="headerlink" title="Step3 Eliminate Any Background Noise"></a>Step3 Eliminate Any Background Noise</h5><p>No one is interested in listening to what’s happening in the background while listening to your podcast. So, before pressing the ‘Record’ button, ensure your environment is as quiet as possible. You can take the following steps to reduce background noises.</p><ul><li>Turn off the fan, air conditioner, or any other noisy appliances.</li><li>Remove noisy kids, roommates, or pets.</li><li>Hang a ‘Do Not Disturb’ sign on your front door.</li><li>Shut your door and windows to avoid noise from outside sources, such as sirens, traffic horns, etc.</li><li>Avoid the rustling sound of paper or moving things around your desk.</li><li>Install noise-canceling software to filter out any background noise.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/zoom-podcasts-recording-3.jpg"                      alt="eliminate background noise"                ></p><h5 id="Step4-Set-Up-Separate-Audio-Tracks-for-Each-Speaker"><a href="#Step4-Set-Up-Separate-Audio-Tracks-for-Each-Speaker" class="headerlink" title="Step4 Set Up Separate Audio Tracks for Each Speaker"></a>Step4 Set Up Separate Audio Tracks for Each Speaker</h5><p>Wouldn’t it be easier to edit your podcast if you recorded audio tracks for each speaker separately? Zoom has this feature of recording separate audio tracks.</p><p>To enable this, go to your zoom ‘Settings’ and click on the ‘Recording’ setting. Then select “Record a separate audio file for each participant,” and you are ready to go.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/zoom-podcasts-recording-4.jpg"                      alt="separate audio tracks for each speaker"                ></p><h5 id="Step5-Brief-Your-Guest-About-Zoom-Functioning-Before-You-Begin"><a href="#Step5-Brief-Your-Guest-About-Zoom-Functioning-Before-You-Begin" class="headerlink" title="Step5 Brief Your Guest About Zoom Functioning Before You Begin"></a>Step5 Brief Your Guest About Zoom Functioning Before You Begin</h5><p>If you are going live and your guest is new to zoom, it is better that you guide him briefly about the functioning of zoom. Guide your guest on how to join the call using zoom. It would be best if you also told him about the duration and topic of your podcast.</p><p>It is advised to test the microphone and headphones of your guest before starting a live podcast. Your guest does not need to download and install zoom on their device; he can join by clicking the link and entering the call from his browser.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/zoom-podcasts-recording-5.jpg"                      alt="brief the guest about zoom functioning"                ></p><h5 id="Step6-Record-the-Call-Using-Zoom"><a href="#Step6-Record-the-Call-Using-Zoom" class="headerlink" title="Step6 Record the Call Using Zoom"></a>Step6 Record the Call Using Zoom</h5><p>It is pretty simple to record a podcast using zoom.

Besides, the recording audio and video quality depend upon your internet speed. If your internet is slow, you will experience lag and interruptions in your recorded podcasts.</p><h3 id="●-Compressed-Audio-and-Video"><a href="#●-Compressed-Audio-and-Video" class="headerlink" title="● Compressed Audio and Video"></a>● Compressed Audio and Video</h3><p>Zoom compresses your audio and video files by removing portions of audio tracks making the file smaller.

It is often used when the first image starts to disappear and the next image starts to display gradually.</p><p>So you can apply Dissolve transition at the beginning of the video from a black screen to fade in, and add dissolve transition at the end of the clip into the blackness to fade out.</p><p>Here is how to add dissolve transition in Filmora.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Mac Version"                > </a></p><ul><li>After importing video footage into Filmora, drag and drop them in the timeline.</li><li>Go to the Transition tab and find Dissolve under the Basic category.

If you are having trouble finding this app, simply type Xbox into the search bar and click on its icon to launch it.</p><h6 id="Enable-Game-Bar-feature"><a href="#Enable-Game-Bar-feature" class="headerlink" title="Enable Game Bar feature"></a>Enable Game Bar feature</h6><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/windows-10-game-bar-image.jpg"                      alt="Record on Windows 10"                ></p><p>Hold the Windows + G buttons until a pop-up screen appears, and then select ‘Yes, this is a game’ option when it popped up “Do you want to open Game Bar” if you are using it for the first time. You will see the Game Bar interface with several controls including the Xbox app, screenshot, screen recording, and settings options. If you want to record your microphone and your voice, just checkbox “Record mic”.</p><h6 id="Record-Screen-Activity"><a href="#Record-Screen-Activity" class="headerlink" title="Record Screen Activity"></a>Record Screen Activity</h6><p>To record your desktop screen activity, you can either hold the Windows, Alt, and R buttons on your keyboard to start the recording session, or you can simply click on the ‘Start Recording’ icon. The same shortcut can be used to stop recording. All videos will be saved in the same destination folder named Video&#x2F;Capture, and the app won’t let you change this setting.</p><p>However, the DVR feature in Xbox app will allow you to choose the duration of your video or increase the quality of the video you’re recording but the mouse cursor will not be recorded. Some computers that support Windows 10 will not let you use this app if your video card doesn’t support AMD VCE, Intel Quick Sync H.260, or Nvidia NVENC encoders.</p><h4 id="2-Using-Built-in-MS-PowerPoint-to-Record-Screen-for-free-on-Windows"><a href="#2-Using-Built-in-MS-PowerPoint-to-Record-Screen-for-free-on-Windows" class="headerlink" title="2.

If you would like to capture an entire screen, hold the Windows, SHIFT, and F keys simultaneously. After you’ve made the selection simply hit the <strong>Record</strong> button to initiate the screen recording session.</p><p>The screen recording options MS PowerPoint provides are somewhat limited, which is the reason why this feature should only be used if you have to produce a screen recording in a short time.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2036481/19272" target="_top" id="2036481">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2036481" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2036481/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Method-2-Using-Free-Screen-Recording-Software-to-Capture-Desktop-Screen-on-Windows"><a href="#Method-2-Using-Free-Screen-Recording-Software-to-Capture-Desktop-Screen-on-Windows" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Using Free Screen Recording Software to Capture Desktop Screen on Windows"></a>Method 2: Using Free Screen Recording Software to Capture Desktop Screen on Windows</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/flashback-express-screen-recording.jpg"                      alt="Record with PPT"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2123508/26400" target="_top" id="2123508">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2123508" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2123508/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>The built-in software on Windows 10 may be a great way to produce a quick screen recording, but if you want to create professional software walkthroughs, let’s play videos or tutorials then using a free screen recording software such as <a class="link"   href="https://www.flashbackrecorder.com/express/" >FlashBack Express <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a much better option.

The introduction of a hybrid console is truly a success that offers an extraordinary graphical quality while transitioning within the home console. Although this unique adaptability needs the compromise over functionality and power compared with the handhelds and dedicated consoles that have been introduced before. The games are played on the home part that is dock and console itself, over which we put the console in the dock to get the output image over the TV screen.</p><p>Moreover, it doesn’t require the installation of the software over the hard drive. It also includes the Micro SD slot at the switch backside, which provides additional storage capacity. But the main question is <strong>how to record switch gameplay</strong>?</p><p>There are basically three ways for <strong>Nintendo switch video capture</strong> gameplay.</p><p>This article will be in two part:</p><hr><p>Part I: Capture Your Switch Video</p><ul><li><a href="#part1"><strong>1. Capture the 30s video with Nintendo Switch Record button</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part2"><strong>2. Record your whole gameplay with game built-in function</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part3"></a><a href="#part3"><strong>3. Record your whole gameplay with Capture Card</strong></a></li></ul><hr><h3 id="1-Capture-the-30s-video-with-Nintendo-Switch-Record-button"><a href="#1-Capture-the-30s-video-with-Nintendo-Switch-Record-button" class="headerlink" title="1. Capture the 30s video with Nintendo Switch Record button"></a>1. Capture the 30s video with Nintendo Switch Record button</h3><p>The controllers come up with the built-in capture button. However, this button only allows the screenshot of the video which is not ideal in any case. But it records the video for 30 seconds as well. If this time is enough to capture your gameplay then do the steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Hold the controller in your hand.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Press the capture button on the left side of controller.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/switch-console-pic.png"                      alt="switch-game-console"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Hold down this capture button marked with the square</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Wait until the message regarding capture completion is received at the screen top</p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Your last 30 seconds of gameplay will be saved in the ‘Albums.’ It will record the 30 seconds gameplay right before you press the button down, so there is no need to worry about hitting it in advance. It is a quite simple step and allows only posting the clips to social media or saving them in your phone album. It also provides video editing before posting it on social media. You will be able to see the Nintendo Switch video capture in the Albums.</p><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/switch-interface.png"                      alt="switch-interface"                ></p><h3 id="2-Record-your-whole-gameplay-with-game-built-in-function"><a href="#2-Record-your-whole-gameplay-with-game-built-in-function" class="headerlink" title="2. Record your whole gameplay with game built-in function"></a>2. Record your whole gameplay with game built-in function</h3><p>If you wish to save some important moves of your game in your album, then here is the second way. Some games have the option of replay saving at their bottoms, <a class="link"   href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a%5Fid/27540/~/how-to-capture-and-edit-gameplay-video" >complete list <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> including:</p><ul><li><em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em></li><li><em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em></li><li><em>ARMS</em></li><li><em>Splatoon 2</em></li></ul><p>Let’s take Smach Bros as an example. To do the recording, follow the steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> As soon as you have finished the game, the screen of the final score appears. A button appears at the top right down corner of the screen ‘Do you want to save the game’. <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/smash-bros-interface.png"                      alt="smash-bro-ending"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Click on the ‘Y’ button and then click on ‘Save.’<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/smash-bros-saving.png"                      alt="smash-bros-saving"                ></p><p>Tips: Make sure that you don’t press buttons other than ‘Y’ if you want to save the gameplay. The game replay will be lost if you do so.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> The video will be saved in the replays where you can check it. Go to the ‘Menu’ and then ‘Replays’, and the saved video will appear here (however, there is one limitation of such replays saved, that is they will be deleted as soon as the game is updated so make sure that you save the game replays in your album).</p><p>To convert the replays in the video, a straightforward option is given in the menu ‘Convert to Video.’ Go to the replay that you would like to save. Look at the right down corner and click on the ‘Convert to Video’ option.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gameplay-quality1.jpg"                      alt="video-quality-interface"                ></p><p>Tips: Within the video conversion settings, you can include information about the display, music, sound effects, and video quality of the replay. Check all these settings and select them the way you want your gameplay to be.
