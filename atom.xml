Microsoft’s PowerPoint program for Windows comes with various customization options for creating a presentation. In addition to text, you can place images, tables, charts, videos, links, and other types of content in your PowerPoint presentation to really make it pop.</p><p>There have been complaints from PowerPoint users about not being able to have direct access to the full detail of the presentation after presenting. One of the most prominent problems is that users want to jot things down, and at the same time, they want to pay full attention to the presenter especially when the presentation is on ‘how to’. There is a tendency to miss little vital information. Also, those who miss presentations on PowerPoint have no hope of getting the presentation in detail.</p><p>Fortunately, there is a solution to the problem. Recording PowerPoint as a video is possible. It is an interesting and helpful idea that could help users go over the whole presentation and get the information as though the PowerPoint presentation is still live. The only difference will be the time at which they watched the presentation.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-record-a-powerpoint-presentation-1.jpg"                      alt="how to record a powerpoint presentation"                ></p><p>This article will:</p><ol><li>Educate you on how to record PowerPoint presentations with video and audio, in a step-by-step approach.</li><li>Show you the benefits of recording PowerPoint presentations.</li><li>Teach you the advantages and disadvantages of using PowerPoint presentations with video and audio</li><li>Recommend a third-party tool to record PowerPoint presentations.</li></ol><h2 id="Part-I-When-you-will-need-to-record-a-PowerPoint"><a href="#Part-I-When-you-will-need-to-record-a-PowerPoint" class="headerlink" title="Part I. When you will need to record a PowerPoint?"></a>Part I. When you will need to record a PowerPoint?</h2><p>There are almost 35 million PowerPoint presentations delivered daily.</p><p>PowerPoint slides are the preferred method of delivering supplementary information that enables audiences to comprehend and relate to the concepts and ideas delivered in presentations, whether in classrooms or boardrooms. Presentations can take several forms, including</p><ul><li>Training and tutorials</li><li>Business and sales presentations</li><li>Executive communications</li><li>Product demos</li><li>Educational lectures</li><li>Student assignments</li><li>And more…</li></ul><p>But after they are delivered, what happens to all of those PowerPoint slides? Depending on the content and target audience, a select few will be shared or preserved, either publicly on SlideShare or privately on SharePoint.</p><p>In most cases, PowerPoint slides on their own, without the corresponding presentation — are incomplete and don’t do the best job of communicating the concepts from the actual presentation. Those ahead of the curve should be to share and archive recordings of their full presentations.</p><h2 id="Part-II-How-to-record-a-PowerPoint-presentation-with-video-and-audio"><a href="#Part-II-How-to-record-a-PowerPoint-presentation-with-video-and-audio" class="headerlink" title="Part II. How to record a PowerPoint presentation with video and audio"></a>Part II. How to record a PowerPoint presentation with video and audio</h2><p>You can record a presentation in real-time as you present, or do it in advance to leverage the flipped model or make your presentation available on-demand.</p><p>While there are several ways to record a presentation, this is one of the easiest ways to record a high-quality presentation in PowerPoint with audio and video.</p><h5 id="Step1-Prepare-Your-PowerPoint-Slides-and-Talking-Points"><a href="#Step1-Prepare-Your-PowerPoint-Slides-and-Talking-Points" class="headerlink" title="Step1 Prepare Your PowerPoint Slides and Talking Points"></a>Step1 Prepare Your PowerPoint Slides and Talking Points</h5><p>Before recording your presentation, ensure your slides are organized correctly and error-free. The function of your PowerPoint presentation is to act as a visual aid for the information you’re presenting, not to present all your information for you. Don’t put too much info on your slides so you won’t be tempted to read directly from them.</p><p>The image below shows how your screen will look when your presentation is ready.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-record-a-powerpoint-presentation-2.jpg"                      alt="prepare your powerpoint slides and talking points"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2115948/19272" target="_top" id="2115948">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2115948" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="336" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2115948/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h5 id="Step2-Select-Your-Audio-and-Video-Sources"><a href="#Step2-Select-Your-Audio-and-Video-Sources" class="headerlink" title="Step2 Select Your Audio and Video Sources"></a>Step2 Select Your Audio and Video Sources</h5><p>You can record video, audio, or just your slide show directly within the Microsoft PowerPoint program. After you’ve opened PowerPoint, select “Recording” from the top navigation bar. This will open a new navigation bar with “Record Slide Show” and “Screen Recording” options.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-record-a-powerpoint-presentation-3.jpg"                      alt="select your audio and video sources"                ></p><p>If you just want to record your slideshow without adding audio or video, you would select “Record Slide Show”. Choosing “Screen Recording” will let you capture your slideshow while at the same time recording audio from your computer and any video on your computer screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"                                     ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137204/26400" target="_top" id="2137204">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137204" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137204/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><strong>Note:</strong> you can start recording from the beginning or you choose a current slide to start recording from.</p><h5 id="Step3-Open-Your-PowerPoint-Slides-and-Capture-the-Screen"><a href="#Step3-Open-Your-PowerPoint-Slides-and-Capture-the-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Step3 Open Your PowerPoint Slides and Capture the Screen"></a>Step3 Open Your PowerPoint Slides and Capture the Screen</h5><p>Choose “Screen Recording,” and you’ll be given the opportunity to select the area on your screen you want to capture. Adjust the red box to fit your Powerpoint presentation.

Once you hit record, you’ll begin capturing everything in the area you’ve selected, and any audio picked up by your computer’s mic.</p><p>If you prefer, you can skip recording audio during this step and add it later. Use the “Audio” option from the PowerPoint navigation if you’re trying to find out how to record PowerPoint presentations with audio you’ve already recorded.</p><h5 id="Step5-Export-the-video-to-achieve-this-follow-the-steps-below"><a href="#Step5-Export-the-video-to-achieve-this-follow-the-steps-below" class="headerlink" title="Step5 Export the video: to achieve this, follow the steps below"></a>Step5 Export the video: to achieve this, follow the steps below</h5><ol><li>Navigate to File, click Export, and choose to Create a Video</li><li>Select the resolution</li><li>Set timing parameters or use recorded timings and narration</li><li>Click on Create Video</li><li>Choose Save as Type and select between MPEG-4 or Windows Media Video</li></ol><p><strong>Pros and Cons of Using PowerPoint to Record Your Presentation</strong></p><p>Consequently, using PowerPoint to record your presentation has some advantages and disadvantages.</p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Easy to create with free resources</li><li>Works great for doing web-based tutorials</li><li>Works great for step-by-step explanations</li><li>Create homework help, how-to’s, problem&#x2F;solution videos, and visual presentations that mark up on the screen</li><li>you can both create the presentation within the program and convert it into a video on the spot</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>PowerPoint isn’t a video editing tool.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="SoundCheck-Evaluation"><a href="#SoundCheck-Evaluation" class="headerlink" title="SoundCheck Evaluation"></a>SoundCheck Evaluation</h2><p>You would have probably needed the recording of the screen of your laptop, for that there are a plethora of options available on the internet. You may use them to produce comprehensive recordings as well as recordings that are limited to a single component or window. The disadvantage is that the free versions of this software sometimes include some very inconvenient restrictions, such as a relatively short time usage or bearing of those annoying presence of watermarks, which might negatively affect the result somewhat.</p><p>We introduce you to an amazing recording software RecordCast by PearlMountain company to record your screen and webcams online. It is a web-based application designed to capture your screen, webcam, and microphone input data. The interface to use the application is very user-friendly. Moreover, it provides free usage capability of up to 5 minutes of maximum recording time. However, for longer recordings, you might need to upgrade them. Let’s have a detailed review of the RecordCast in the coming sections.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Key-Features-of-RecordCast"><a href="#Part-1-Key-Features-of-RecordCast" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Key Features of RecordCast"></a>Part 1: Key Features of RecordCast</h2><p>Software is best analyzed by the features it has to offer. The RecordCast is equipped with amazing features that you can avail of directly online through the web. Let’s discuss these features one by one to explore them for your ease.</p><p>**<strong>Free and User-Friendly</strong></p><p>The first and the foremost prevalent perk of a RecordCast is its free usage for its users. The application provides you to sign in free of cost to avail of its recording capabilities without any watermark issues. Moreover, the GUI of the web-based application is very easy to use that only needs a few steps to do the job.</p><p>**<strong>Multiple Recording Modes:</strong></p><p>With the 3 recording modes of the RecordCast, it leads all other similar software which usually has single recording modes. The three recording modes let you choose to record webcam + screen simultaneously or one at a time.</p><p>**<strong>All-in-One:</strong></p><p>The RecordCast is not only designed to record screens but with its video editing tools, you can now edit, trim, change colors, apply filters and put artistic effects on any video online. This amazing feature makes it a competitor for video editor tools too.</p><p>**<strong>Protected:</strong></p><p>With great care for privacy and security, RecordCast stores and edit your video or recordings locally. It doesn’t upload your content to the web servers instead, it never shares your content with any third party.</p><p>**<strong>Fair Pricing:</strong></p><p>The free version of RecordCast let you record a screen or webcam for a maximum of 5 minutes. However, it can be upgraded to its premium version so you can avail all its features by only paying 2.99 $ per month. This is very fair considering other similar software pricing.</p><p>**<strong>Compatibility:</strong></p><p>Due to the online nature of the RecordCast, it is compatible with any computer. Whether it is a Mac or Windows, you will not have to set up any compatibility settings before using it. This gives it an edge over other similar software.</p><p>**<strong>No Storage:</strong></p><p>Normally, you need to download an application and then install it for its usage. However, in the case of RecordCast, you save a considerable amount of storage by not installing it on your PC.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1424531">                    <video width="864" height="NaN" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1424531.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1424531">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1424531.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Flaganoo.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1424531%2F16446'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1424531/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Use-RecordCast"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Use-RecordCast" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Use RecordCast"></a>Part 2: How to Use RecordCast</h2><p>With the three RecordCast, you can record your screen or webcam, download it and edit it the way you like to online.

It has a <strong>6-element glass lens</strong> and delivers <strong>1080p at an admirable 30 FPS</strong>. It also has <strong>automatic low-light correction</strong>, which is so important to us! The result is precise and dependable streaming quality, without the need for an expensive lighting setup.</p><p>Working with OBS Studio, the Ontop+ is designed to optimise your videos for YouTube and <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Twitch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

Ontop+ wanted to challenge this assumption and make a webcam with fantastic audio quality. With <strong>built-in dual digital noise-cancellation microphones</strong>, Ontop+ claim their camera will work in all environments. Unfortunately, they haven’t quite lived up to the hype and the audio is occasionally patchy. But, at just under $50 we are willing to overlook some of the Ontop+’s limitations to give it our seal of approval.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul><li>Price</li><li>1080p HD streaming</li><li>Wide-angle viewing lens</li><li>Optimised for YouTube and Twitch</li></ul><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul><li>Audio quality</li><li>Average Amazon rating</li></ul><h4 id="2-Logitech-BRIO"><a href="#2-Logitech-BRIO" class="headerlink" title="2.

It is the only external webcam with an <strong>Intel RealSense 3D camera</strong>, state of the art depth-sensing technology allows you to give more viewing space to the game and gives your viewers a more engaging experience.</p><p>However, the <a class="link"   href="https://www.tomsguide.com/us/intel-realsense-guide,news-20286.html?_ga=2.47407079.1755955212.1524468879-954383139.1524153897" >Intel RealSense camera <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> limits the camera’s compatibility to Windows 10 computers with sixth-generation or later Intel Core CPUs. This is a minimum specification that non-RealSense webcams don’t require.</p><p>Like most of its competitors the Stargazer streams <strong>1,920 x 1,080 at 30 FPS (Full HD)</strong> and <strong>1,280 x 720 at 60 FPS (HD).</strong> With the Stargazer, you will have good screen resolution, but you will not be the sharpest-looking streamer on platforms like Twitch. Occasionally, the Kiyo will struggle to focus in low-light settings, but it does have <strong>fantastic colour accuracy</strong>. What it does have over its competitors though is audio. The Stargazer wins out here because it’s <strong>fantastic at filtering out ambient noise</strong>.</p><p>If you don’t have the room or money for a physical green screen or an external mic but want effortless and professional performance the Razer Stargazer is the webcam for you, with prices starting at <strong><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Stargazer-Depth-Sensing-Webcam-1080P/dp/B01GE9QM5M" >only $150 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul><li>Incredible background removal technology</li><li>Great audio</li><li>Cost</li></ul><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul><li>Not as good video quality as some of its competitors</li><li>Not compatible with older generation computers</li></ul><p>Streamers on platforms such as Twitch, seem to be choosing Logitech cameras most often. However, although the BRIO delivers unbeatable performance for gaming, there are now other brands challenging Logitech’s gaming supremacy. Razer has two innovative cameras on this list.

It has a <strong>6-element glass lens</strong> and delivers <strong>1080p at an admirable 30 FPS</strong>. It also has <strong>automatic low-light correction</strong>, which is so important to us! The result is precise and dependable streaming quality, without the need for an expensive lighting setup.</p><p>Working with OBS Studio, the Ontop+ is designed to optimise your videos for YouTube and <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Twitch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. The wide-angle view also gives you impressive <strong>80-degree panoramic views</strong>.</p><p>Now, it is often assumed that audio is something which lets even the most expensive webcams down. Ontop+ wanted to challenge this assumption and make a webcam with fantastic audio quality. With <strong>built-in dual digital noise-cancellation microphones</strong>, Ontop+ claim their camera will work in all environments. Unfortunately, they haven’t quite lived up to the hype and the audio is occasionally patchy. But, at just under $50 we are willing to overlook some of the Ontop+’s limitations to give it our seal of approval.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul><li>Price</li><li>1080p HD streaming</li><li>Wide-angle viewing lens</li><li>Optimised for YouTube and Twitch</li></ul><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul><li>Audio quality</li><li>Average Amazon rating</li></ul><h4 id="2-Logitech-BRIO-1"><a href="#2-Logitech-BRIO-1" class="headerlink" title="2.

It has a <strong>6-element glass lens</strong> and delivers <strong>1080p at an admirable 30 FPS</strong>. It also has <strong>automatic low-light correction</strong>, which is so important to us! The result is precise and dependable streaming quality, without the need for an expensive lighting setup.</p><p>Working with OBS Studio, the Ontop+ is designed to optimise your videos for YouTube and <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Twitch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. The wide-angle view also gives you impressive <strong>80-degree panoramic views</strong>.</p><p>Now, it is often assumed that audio is something which lets even the most expensive webcams down. Ontop+ wanted to challenge this assumption and make a webcam with fantastic audio quality. With <strong>built-in dual digital noise-cancellation microphones</strong>, Ontop+ claim their camera will work in all environments. Unfortunately, they haven’t quite lived up to the hype and the audio is occasionally patchy. But, at just under $50 we are willing to overlook some of the Ontop+’s limitations to give it our seal of approval.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul><li>Price</li><li>1080p HD streaming</li><li>Wide-angle viewing lens</li><li>Optimised for YouTube and Twitch</li></ul><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul><li>Audio quality</li><li>Average Amazon rating</li></ul><h4 id="2-Logitech-BRIO-2"><a href="#2-Logitech-BRIO-2" class="headerlink" title="2.

It has a <strong>6-element glass lens</strong> and delivers <strong>1080p at an admirable 30 FPS</strong>. It also has <strong>automatic low-light correction</strong>, which is so important to us! The result is precise and dependable streaming quality, without the need for an expensive lighting setup.</p><p>Working with OBS Studio, the Ontop+ is designed to optimise your videos for YouTube and <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Twitch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. The wide-angle view also gives you impressive <strong>80-degree panoramic views</strong>.</p><p>Now, it is often assumed that audio is something which lets even the most expensive webcams down. Ontop+ wanted to challenge this assumption and make a webcam with fantastic audio quality. With <strong>built-in dual digital noise-cancellation microphones</strong>, Ontop+ claim their camera will work in all environments. Unfortunately, they haven’t quite lived up to the hype and the audio is occasionally patchy. But, at just under $50 we are willing to overlook some of the Ontop+’s limitations to give it our seal of approval.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul><li>Price</li><li>1080p HD streaming</li><li>Wide-angle viewing lens</li><li>Optimised for YouTube and Twitch</li></ul><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul><li>Audio quality</li><li>Average Amazon rating</li></ul><h4 id="2-Logitech-BRIO-3"><a href="#2-Logitech-BRIO-3" class="headerlink" title="2.

It also supports <strong>Logitech RightLight 3 with HDR</strong> which gives it exceptional performance regardless of the light conditions. Plus, you can choose between a 65-degree, 78-degree, and a 90-degree field of vision, privacy shade and a flexible mount.</p><p>For professional streamers, this is a fantastic investment piece.

This is a minimum specification that non-RealSense webcams don’t require.</p><p>Like most of its competitors the Stargazer streams <strong>1,920 x 1,080 at 30 FPS (Full HD)</strong> and <strong>1,280 x 720 at 60 FPS (HD).</strong> With the Stargazer, you will have good screen resolution, but you will not be the sharpest-looking streamer on platforms like Twitch. Occasionally, the Kiyo will struggle to focus in low-light settings, but it does have <strong>fantastic colour accuracy</strong>. What it does have over its competitors though is audio.

MOV file format is developed by Apple, and hence, it is the default video file format on Mac. However, you can play MOV files on Windows PC by installing QuickTime. In fact, you can use Windows Media Player 12 as well as VLC Media Player to play MOV files. But the question arises how to record MOV files on Windows 10.</p><p>If you want to capture high resolution and high bitrate video without any compression, you have to opt for MOV instead of MP4. That is why professional video creators prefer MOV file format over MP4 so that there is no compromise with the quality. In order to record MOV files, you will need a video recorder that supports saving your recorded video in MOV file format. In this article, we will illustrate how to record MOV files in the simplest steps on Windows PC.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://zebaoaffiliateprogram.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137976/21526" target="_top" id="2137976">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21526-2137976" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://zebaoaffiliateprogram.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137976/21526"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-1-Best-MOV-Video-Recorder"><a href="#Part-1-Best-MOV-Video-Recorder" class="headerlink" title="Part 1.

A layer can be described as any type of image, moving or still, that is superimposed over a background image. However, just adding one layer over another will not create a strong visual impact on the spectator, which is why using Blending Modes is recommended if you want to <strong>blend two overlaying videos or images</strong> seamlessly.</p><p>It is a widely accepted opinion that Blend Modes can only be used in Adobe Premiere Pro or After Effects, but in this article, we are going to bust that myth and show you how to utilize Blending Modes in Filmora Scrn.

Two pieces of film are transparent, but the images they contain do not mix with each other, that is why when you are using Blend Modes in Filmora Scrn you are actually merging videos and allowing their pixels to mix.</p><p>Different ways of combining pixels are called modes, and for that reason, the properties of the <strong>Linear Burn mode</strong> are not the same as the properties of the <strong>Multiply blending mode</strong>. Each mode you select, brings preset image transparency as well as brightness, contrast and color values. Which mode you will use depends mostly on the context and the images you want to use in your video.</p><p>The <strong>Normal mode</strong> is a part of the standard set of blending modes in almost all photo and video editing programs. It enables you to keep the top layer intact, by preventing the pixels from two images to merge. It is a perfect PIP blending mode since it allows you to keep two overlaying images separate and have two different narratives within the same shot. Producers of YouTube videos and tutorials of any kind or gamers who want to entertain their audiences should use the Normal mode when editing their footage captured with Filmora Scrn.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-scrn-normal-mode.jpg"                      alt=" Filmora Scrn Blending modes"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2123466/16836" target="_top" id="2123466">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2123466" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2123466/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>The <strong>Screen Mode</strong> is best used when you are working with dark monochrome backgrounds because it reduces the dark areas in the video thus enabling you to blend the top layer into the background seamlessly.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-scrn-screen-mode.jpg"                      alt=" Filmora Scrn Blending modes"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134249/18498" target="_top" id="2134249">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134249" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134249/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Utilizing this mode successfully requires previous preparation because the effects you’ll get if you use the Screen mode with a footage that is not best suited for this mode are far from impressive.

Key Features of CamStudio</h2><p>Instead of being a completely free screen recorder, CamStudio allows several customization options so that the recording could be as per your requirements. Even though the features are limited, here are the key features of CamStudio recorder you should be aware of.</p><p>Video Recording – You can record your screen as well as webcam video individually as well as simultaneously.</p><p>Audio Recording – Along with videos, you can record audio from your system as well as external microphone. In fact, you can mute audio and record only the video.</p><p>Custom Recording Area – You can select a certain portion of the screen for recording as well as select application window or full screen for recording. Instead of a fixed region, you can vary the region of recording as per your requirement.</p><p>Add Components – There is an option for adding annotations if you need it. Besides, you can attach a fixed watermark or text to the recorded video. Moreover, you can add a timestamp on the video if you have such requirements.</p><p>Autopan and Others – Autopan is a unique feature of CamStudio screen recorder whereby you can record as you move your mouse. You can also highlight your mouse cursor as well as automatically stop recording when you are away.</p><p>Output File Format – You can save your recording in MP4, AVI and SWF as you find suitable. It can also automatically name the recording file and save without your intervention after recording.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Alternative-Way-to-Record-Screen"><a href="#Part-3-Alternative-Way-to-Record-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Alternative Way to Record Screen"></a>Part 3. Alternative Way to Record Screen</h2><p>CamStudio is an easy-to-use and completely free screen recorder, but it lacks several useful features. First of all, there is no basic editing option available. The output file format is limited. There are very limited customizable configuration settings available. Moreover, CamStudio is only suitable for Windows users. The user interface is outdated, and it is not suitable for recording very high-quality screen videos such as gameplay. That is why there is a need for a better CamStudio alternative.</p><p>If you are looking for a professional <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >screen recorder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, we recommend Wondershare Filmora. Filmora comes with an inbuilt video editor, and therefore, you can get your recorded video ready for publishing after recording.

High-quality music output</strong></p><p>One of the basic requirements for any audio recorder is that the output quality for the recorded files must be crystal clear and shouldn’t be of low quality. And Sound Studio meets all these aspects in voice recording by providing its users HD quality output sounds with simple and easy steps.</p><p><strong>2. Multiple formats support</strong></p><p>The application is also enabled with multiple audio format supports which means that there are several formats in which you can create your record as well as export it.

In this way, everyone can save their old dusty records into digital formats which will enable them to modify the voice configurations and then edit them with different layers of effects.</p><p><strong>5. Batch processing using AppleScript or Automator</strong></p><p>For people who want to process their audio in a batch or want to combine different audio recordings at the same time, they can use the AppleScript or any Automator for the same since Sound Studio supports the integration of both thus enabling a more powerful part of audio processing.</p><p><strong>6. Live performance recording</strong></p><p>There are situations where we want to record the ongoing live performances from our systems and in such scenarios, Sound Studio can help you efficiently.
