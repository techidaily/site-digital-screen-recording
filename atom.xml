It’s difficult to walk down the street on PC without zombie games grabbing at your leg, so it’s a legitimate concern. Don’t write off the genre because there are a few brainless clones - we’ve compiled a list of some of the zombie games to hit PC.</p><p>There are a lot of zombie enemies in the zombie games, and they enjoy eating brains, and there’s a lot more to them than that. You’ll be forced to put your survival and fighting abilities to the test in a hostile environment, and you’ll discover how humankind can come together in the face of hardship. The zombie games provide a wide range of action-packed adventures that are both complex and entertaining.</p><p>Here are the greatest zombie videogames you can play right now, starting with number 10 and working your way up to our top one pick. Our list of zombie games contains tales with repercussions, resource management, traditional Capcom danger, and more. You’ll be able to discover your new zombie-filled adventure here since it covers a wide range of genres.</p><h3 id="1-Worldwar-Z"><a href="#1-Worldwar-Z" class="headerlink" title="1.Worldwar Z"></a>1.Worldwar Z</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/worldwar-z-poster.jpg"                      alt="worldwar-z-poster"                ></p><p>There isn’t much to World War Z by itself, but there isn’t a better game for mow down dozens, if not hundreds, of zombies with a group of friends or strangers. It’s based in part on the Brad Pitt film from 2013. Nonetheless, it’s mainly an excuse to repeat the film’s one distinguishing attribute: swarms of monsters that rush down streets and crash around curves like a torrent through a breached dam.</p><p>It is undeniably influenced by the Left 4 Dead series (RIP). It does, however, have several modern game mainstays like selectable classes &amp; permanent progression. You may choose to play as a Horror flick, who gets extra health by rapidly killing enemies, a Fixer, who places traps in safe areas, or even one of four additional classes. Whatever character you select to level up first, you’ll get to fire a lot of lead into sliding walls of decaying flesh.</p><h3 id="2-Dying-Light-The-Following"><a href="#2-Dying-Light-The-Following" class="headerlink" title="2.Dying Light: The Following"></a>2.Dying Light: The Following</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/dying-light-the-following-poster.jpg"                      alt="dying-light-the-following-poster"                ></p><p>Running over zombies has never been more fun. The Foregoing is really a DLC for Dying Light that eliminates much of the parkour again from the original game and instead places you behind the wheel of a car across a stretch of nearly spotless countryside. Splatter zombies spewing gore and leave tire tracks in their guts as you drive across the fields, attempting daring jumps. Just make sure you don’t get a monster head caught in your wipers.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1484940/16446" target="_top" id="1484940">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1484940" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1484940/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-State-of-the-Decay-2"><a href="#3-State-of-the-Decay-2" class="headerlink" title="3.State of the Decay 2"></a>3.State of the Decay 2</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/state-of-the-decay-2-poster.jpg"                      alt="state-of-the-decay-2-poster"                ></p><p>Unlike Project Zomboid, which concentrates primarily on the concept of being an ordinary person in an unfair position, the States of Decay series tries to keep you amused with the beautiful midwestern countryside and Gorey entertaining combat even while your supplies run out and zombies smash down your gate.</p><p>The introduction of multiplayer in States of Decay 2 is probably the most intriguing new feature. Inviting people to help protect and hunt for your village greatly expands the scope of procedurally produced tales. It also enables you to put to the test all of those zombie outbreak survival tactics you’ve spent way too much time talking with your pals.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2130885/7443" target="_top" id="2130885">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2130885" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2130885/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="4-Resident-Evil-2-remake-of-2019"><a href="#4-Resident-Evil-2-remake-of-2019" class="headerlink" title="4.Resident Evil 2 (remake of 2019)"></a>4.Resident Evil 2 (remake of 2019)</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/resident-evil-2-poster.jpg"                      alt="resident-evil-2-poster"                ></p><p>Resident Evil 2’s sequel treads a thin line between the sluggish horror of the original Resident Evil game and the quicker (but still methodical) action of the post-Resident Evil 7 period. It succeeds in being both a worthy homage to the first Resident Evil 2 and the most important, playable RE games in years as a result of this. The key is the zombies, as you’d expect from a game that ranks among the zombie games. Even while the remake’s mobility and shooting controls seem to be more contemporary and streamlined, each zombie can only take so many shots - even headshot - before resurrecting. Even immediately in front of your eyes, or perhaps a few minutes later, when you believe you are secure.</p><p>In the remake of Resident Evil 2, the perfect aim isn’t enough to ensure your life. The most essential element is caution since you save ammunition by firing to stun rather than kill. You could even decide the zombies can take the passageway while you retain the ammunition. It’s still not as terrifying as the other major Resident Evil remake in terms of sheer dread. However, the Resident Evil 2’s remake is undoubtedly more enjoyable to play, earning it a place on our list of zombie games.</p><h3 id="5-The-Walking-Dead"><a href="#5-The-Walking-Dead" class="headerlink" title="5.The Walking Dead"></a>5.The Walking Dead</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/the-walking-dead-poster.jpg"                      alt="the-walking-dead-poster"                ></p><p>You play Lee Everett, a convicted murderer who takes in an orphaned young girl called Clementine as his charge. You’ll make choices that will have significant repercussions for your group members when you meet more survivors. The worst part is that you develop feelings for the people in your group. As a consequence, when bad things happen, you’ll feel as though you’ve just seen a real-life buddy being eaten rather than a video game character. People will die, unexpected events will occur, and choices will need to be made. You’ll have to live with the repercussions.</p><h3 id="6-The-HD-Remaster-of-Resident-Evil"><a href="#6-The-HD-Remaster-of-Resident-Evil" class="headerlink" title="6.The HD Remaster of Resident Evil"></a>6.The HD Remaster of Resident Evil</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/remaster-of-resident-evil-poster.png"                      alt="remaster-of-resident-evil-poster"                ></p><p>The utter loneliness of becoming one of the last humans with a heartbeat within some several-mile radius is something that the first Resident Evil gets right that many zombie games miss out on. Resident Evil High-Definition Remaster is a somewhat updated version of Resident Evil GameCube update from 2002, maintaining the terrible desolation in its entirety.

Don’t get us wrong: the 2015 remake should have done a lot more (those pre-rendered backdrops are starting to seem a little fuzzy these days), but what’s there is still a landmark survival horror classic.</p><p>The Resident Evil update isn’t just one of the best zombie games because of its unique perspective on the undead; it’s one of the best zombie games because of its unique perspective what to do, in particular, with one that seems to have ceased to move.

It sends you on a perilous cross-country journey across a largely post-human America. The planet is filled with desperate weapon survivalists, a totalitarian government, and violent rebel groups, apart from mushroom-brained undead with fangs eager to tear your jugular out. The greatest part is that you have to do it all with a sassy young woman who alternates between making fun of you and rescuing your life.</p><p>The journey of Joel and Ellie would be both dark and terrifying.

You’re smack dab in the middle of a battle with the Ridden. That once hosts of a terrible infection have evolved into frightening monsters intent on eating civilization’s ruins. It’s up to you and your allies to take the battle to the enemy, eliminate the Ridden, and recapture the planet, with humanity’s extinction on the line.</p><h4 id="Wondershare-Filmora-2"><a href="#Wondershare-Filmora-2" class="headerlink" title="Wondershare Filmora"></a>Wondershare Filmora</h4><p>Get started today with Filmora’s powerful performance, user-friendly interface, and thousands of effects!</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Learn More &gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://neveragain.allstatics.com/2019/assets/image/box/filmora-9.png"                                     ></p><p>There isn’t much to World War Z by itself, but there isn’t a better game for mow down dozens, if not hundreds, of zombies with a group of friends or strangers. It’s based in part on the Brad Pitt film from 2013. Nonetheless, it’s mainly an excuse to repeat the film’s one distinguishing attribute: swarms of monsters that rush down streets and crash around curves like a torrent through a breached dam.</p><p>It is undeniably influenced by the Left 4 Dead series (RIP). It does, however, have several modern game mainstays like selectable classes &amp; permanent progression. You may choose to play as a Horror flick, who gets extra health by rapidly killing enemies, a Fixer, who places traps in safe areas, or even one of four additional classes. Whatever character you select to level up first, you’ll get to fire a lot of lead into sliding walls of decaying flesh.</p><h3 id="2-Dying-Light-The-Following-3"><a href="#2-Dying-Light-The-Following-3" class="headerlink" title="2.Dying Light: The Following"></a>2.Dying Light: The Following</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/dying-light-the-following-poster.jpg"                      alt="dying-light-the-following-poster"                ></p><p>Running over zombies has never been more fun. The Foregoing is really a DLC for Dying Light that eliminates much of the parkour again from the original game and instead places you behind the wheel of a car across a stretch of nearly spotless countryside. Splatter zombies spewing gore and leave tire tracks in their guts as you drive across the fields, attempting daring jumps. Just make sure you don’t get a monster head caught in your wipers.</p><h3 id="3-State-of-the-Decay-2-3"><a href="#3-State-of-the-Decay-2-3" class="headerlink" title="3.State of the Decay 2"></a>3.State of the Decay 2</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/state-of-the-decay-2-poster.jpg"                      alt="state-of-the-decay-2-poster"                ></p><p>Unlike Project Zomboid, which concentrates primarily on the concept of being an ordinary person in an unfair position, the States of Decay series tries to keep you amused with the beautiful midwestern countryside and Gorey entertaining combat even while your supplies run out and zombies smash down your gate.</p><p>The introduction of multiplayer in States of Decay 2 is probably the most intriguing new feature. Inviting people to help protect and hunt for your village greatly expands the scope of procedurally produced tales. It also enables you to put to the test all of those zombie outbreak survival tactics you’ve spent way too much time talking with your pals.</p><h3 id="4-Resident-Evil-2-remake-of-2019-3"><a href="#4-Resident-Evil-2-remake-of-2019-3" class="headerlink" title="4.Resident Evil 2 (remake of 2019)"></a>4.Resident Evil 2 (remake of 2019)</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/resident-evil-2-poster.jpg"                      alt="resident-evil-2-poster"                ></p><p>Resident Evil 2’s sequel treads a thin line between the sluggish horror of the original Resident Evil game and the quicker (but still methodical) action of the post-Resident Evil 7 period. It succeeds in being both a worthy homage to the first Resident Evil 2 and the most important, playable RE games in years as a result of this. The key is the zombies, as you’d expect from a game that ranks among the zombie games. Even while the remake’s mobility and shooting controls seem to be more contemporary and streamlined, each zombie can only take so many shots - even headshot - before resurrecting. Even immediately in front of your eyes, or perhaps a few minutes later, when you believe you are secure.</p><p>In the remake of Resident Evil 2, the perfect aim isn’t enough to ensure your life. The most essential element is caution since you save ammunition by firing to stun rather than kill. You could even decide the zombies can take the passageway while you retain the ammunition. It’s still not as terrifying as the other major Resident Evil remake in terms of sheer dread. However, the Resident Evil 2’s remake is undoubtedly more enjoyable to play, earning it a place on our list of zombie games.</p><h3 id="5-The-Walking-Dead-3"><a href="#5-The-Walking-Dead-3" class="headerlink" title="5.The Walking Dead"></a>5.The Walking Dead</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/the-walking-dead-poster.jpg"                      alt="the-walking-dead-poster"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2129738/7443" target="_top" id="2129738">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2129738" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2129738/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>You play Lee Everett, a convicted murderer who takes in an orphaned young girl called Clementine as his charge.

However, diverging from regular practice can sometimes lead to creative and interesting results.</p><p>Well, <strong>night-mode portraits</strong> can be such an opportunity. However, it can be a little challenging for you. Night portrait shoots require the photographer to manipulate shutter speed, aperture, ISO, and more. Besides, there are certain dos and don’ts that you also need to keep in mind. Keep reading to know more about this.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/night-potraits.jpg"                      alt="night potraits"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Must-Dos-in-Night-Portraits"><a href="#Part-1-Must-Dos-in-Night-Portraits" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Must-Dos in Night Portraits"></a>Part 1: Must-Dos in Night Portraits</h2><p>Let’s start this discussion by exploring the major dos related to <strong>night portraits</strong> photoshoots. Some dos that you should consider are:</p><h3 id="1-Shooting-with-a-topic"><a href="#1-Shooting-with-a-topic" class="headerlink" title="1. Shooting with a topic"></a>1. Shooting with a topic</h3><p>One of the most difficult repercussions of <strong>night mode portraits</strong> is that everything in your sight takes on a strange appeal, which can easily make it challenging to understand the composition and picture subject. Well, to avoid such an issue, you need to make yourself familiarized with your topic or subject. So, you can arrive at the location before sunset and begin the setup procedure.</p><p>This will also allow you to take advantage of clicking pictures during special hour lighting. Besides, it will also help you to know how changing list settings can affect the scene. Another important thing to consider here is styling your subject. You need to make sure that your subjects look professional and choose the right type of clothing. So, try to understand the purpose of your <strong>night mode portraits.</strong></p><h3 id="2-Lighting-your-Subject"><a href="#2-Lighting-your-Subject" class="headerlink" title="2. Lighting your Subject"></a>2. Lighting your Subject</h3><p>While shooting <strong>night portraits,</strong> based on the location, you may not get sufficient natural light to light up the subject. This is where you need to use some types of artificial lighting. Without this, you may not be able to capture the details of your subject. Your shots will look very blurry and underexposed. Well, artificial lighting need not be a flash. The source of artificial lighting can be anything.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/pexels-matheus-bertelli-573298.jpg"                      alt="pexels matheus bertelli 573298"                ></p><p>For example, it can be a car light, a phone flashlight, a billboard light and anything that can light up the subject, offering a decent amount of illumination to your camera. Make sure that the light is accessible. Experts suggest using off-camera flashlights for <strong>night portraits</strong> as it offers better flexibility. Based on your requirements, you can adjust the direction and brightness. Using a light stand can also be very helpful here.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2105882/7443" target="_top" id="2105882">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2105882" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2105882/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-Make-Good-Use-of-Night-Mode-Portrait"><a href="#3-Make-Good-Use-of-Night-Mode-Portrait" class="headerlink" title="3. Make Good Use of Night Mode Portrait"></a>3. Make Good Use of Night Mode Portrait</h3><p>Don’t forget to take advantage of your camera’s night mode portrait option to get stunning results. Sometimes, you need to depend on software instead of your camera’s hardware for better results. Post-processing can enhance the exposure, level colors, effectively tune white balance, etc., and night mode can help you with that. When you choose this option, the camera will consider different factors, like the movement of the subjects, camera, light settings and more.</p><p>The camera will then take a series of photos at multiple exposure levels and then merge them to create a single image with great details. Even though <strong>night mode portraits</strong> can help you a lot, they may not work well while taking photos of moving objects. The reason behind this is that this mode takes multiple shots, and moving subjects would be blurred out. If it is a static scene, then go for it.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2043617/7443" target="_top" id="2043617">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2043617" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2043617/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="4-Shooting-with-a-Stabilizer"><a href="#4-Shooting-with-a-Stabilizer" class="headerlink" title="4. Shooting with a Stabilizer"></a>4. Shooting with a Stabilizer</h3><p>For better results, you can use a camera stabilizer. A camera stabilizer will offer you the ability to take beautiful and smooth shots while moving. Stabilizers come in different configurations and sizes. They can effectively lower the vibration of the camera while moving. But shooting with a monopod, gimbal, or other rigs can be a little challenging for you. However, there are some tips that you can keep in your mind for better results, for example:</p><ul><li>Always try to maintain a perfect distance from the subject.</li><li>Use wheels.</li><li>You can also use electronic panning.</li><li>Walk carefully.</li><li>Close down the aperture.</li><li>Allow your subject to move into the focus distance.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/pexels-marcelo-dias-1970482.jpg"                      alt="pexels marcelo dias 1970482"                ></p><p>Experts suggest using a sturdy camera tripod, and it will be better to get a remote release. With this, you can trigger the camera without touching the shutter button, and it will reduce the movement of the camera.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Don’t-Dos-in-Night-Portraits"><a href="#Part-2-Don’t-Dos-in-Night-Portraits" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Don’t-Dos in Night Portraits"></a>Part 2: Don’t-Dos in Night Portraits</h2><h3 id="1-Don’t-dress-in-dark"><a href="#1-Don’t-dress-in-dark" class="headerlink" title="1. Don’t dress in dark"></a>1. Don’t dress in dark</h3><p>When it comes to wearing black for night portraits, experts suggest avoiding it unless you have proper light settings and you have your make-up done by an expert who can correct the color for shadows. Sometimes, dark clothes may create an aging effect on the subject. Besides, if the lighting condition is not good, the photos will become much darker due to your dark dress. So, wear light-colored dresses. Besides, don’t use shirts that have visible text, brand names or logos.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/pexels-nikolai-ulltang-572463.jpg"                      alt="pexels nikolai ulltang 572463"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1997680/19272" target="_top" id="1997680">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1997680" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1997680/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-Don’t-do-a-capture-shoot"><a href="#2-Don’t-do-a-capture-shoot" class="headerlink" title="2. Don’t do a capture shoot"></a>2. Don’t do a capture shoot</h3><p>Most photographers use single shooting mode or go for the capture shoot in many cases. That could be the manual mode, and sometimes it is done to adjust the shutter and aperture manually. During night shooting, some photographers use higher ISO. This means the lens will allow more light to come in. As a result, it can create a smear while capturing a moving object. But in some cases, using continuous shooting can help you to capture some of the best moments for <strong>night portraits.</strong> If you are shooting in a fast-paced scenario, then this can help you a lot. You may not use all the images you have captured, but you can find perfect portraits.</p><h3 id="3-Don’t-Overuse-Light-The-Right-Shutter-Speed-ISO-and-Aperture"><a href="#3-Don’t-Overuse-Light-The-Right-Shutter-Speed-ISO-and-Aperture" class="headerlink" title="3. Don’t Overuse Light- The Right Shutter Speed, ISO and Aperture"></a>3. Don’t Overuse Light- The Right Shutter Speed, ISO and Aperture</h3><p>Another thing you need to avoid here is the overuse of light. You need to work on the primary exposure settings, i.e., the ISO, aperture and shutter speed. You should keep in mind that these three configurations will create exposure and influence the photos’ overall brightness. One thing to consider while choosing the setting is to have a photo with a lot of detail in the mid-tones, highlights, and shadows.</p><p>When you overuse the light, it can affect the scene’s depth of field. Besides, the sharpness of the subject will also get affected by this. To control the light, you need to choose the aperture based on the depth of field. For example, for a shallow effect, you can go for a wide aperture, like f&#x2F;2.8. You can use a narrower aperture, like f&#x2F;8, for a sharper background.</p><p>Talking about the shutter speed, for stationary subjects, you can go for 1&#x2F;160s. If it is a moving subject, then 1&#x2F;500s or above can work for you. Now, coming to the ISO, the default ISO value, i.e., ISO 100, is good for taking the highest-quality photos. If you think your portraits are overexposed, then increase the shutter speed to control the light.</p><h3 id="4-Don’t-forget-about-white-balance-and-Adjust-It-Before-Shooting"><a href="#4-Don’t-forget-about-white-balance-and-Adjust-It-Before-Shooting" class="headerlink" title="4. Don’t forget about white balance and Adjust It Before Shooting"></a>4. Don’t forget about white balance and Adjust It Before Shooting</h3><p>Speaking about white balance, it is a setting to make sure the colors in the photos are natural and accurate and the photos don’t have unrealistic colors. If the subject appears white in real but blue or red in the photos, then you need to adjust the white balance. Daylight white balance will be very warm for night photos. That’s why you need to go for cooler settings, around 3200 to 4800, based on your environment and location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/pexels-simon-robben-473107.jpg"                      alt="pexels simon robben 473107"                ></p><p>For example, in city areas, a lower setting, i.e., 3400 to 3900k, can work great. On the other hand, for darker skies, white balance settings of 4000k and above will offer you the best results. Begin with the above suggestion and click some test photos while increasing 100k after every shot to find the right white balance settings.</p><p>However, you can also preset the white balance in your camera or edit the photos during post-processing to adjust the white balance. For example, you can use color correction to fix colors. Using this, you can make the photos look brighter or darker to make them appear natural and realistic. Always use a vector scope to make sure that your colors are accurate.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136619/26400" target="_top" id="2136619">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2136619" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136619/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="FAQs"><a href="#FAQs" class="headerlink" title="FAQs"></a>FAQs</h2><h3 id="How-To-Capture-Good-Portraits-at-Night"><a href="#How-To-Capture-Good-Portraits-at-Night" class="headerlink" title="How To Capture Good Portraits at Night?"></a>How To Capture Good Portraits at Night?</h3><p>As per the experts, the lower the aperture, the more light your camera will receive. This can make your <strong>night mode portraits</strong> difficult. So, you need to go for a slower shutter speed and make sure that there will be subject or camera movement.

Besides, utilizing long camera shutter speeds, around 30 seconds to 60 seconds, will be good. Sometimes, using auto-white balance, you can get great results.

This process may sound daunting at first, but with time and experience, you’ll come to realize why most online marketers think that webinars are the second most effective b2b marketing strategy.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-Does-a-Webinar-Work"><a href="#Part-2-How-Does-a-Webinar-Work" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How Does a Webinar Work?"></a>Part 2: How Does a Webinar Work?</h2><p>A web-based seminar is run by a presenter, a person who provides information relevant to the webinar’s topic to attendees. In order to record a webinar, you’ll need a computer that is equipped with a webcam, a pair of headphones and a microphone, or you can use a Smartphone as an alternative. Most webinar software products offer tools that enable the presenter to insert all types of documents, draw on the screen and use other methods of explaining the topic to the viewers.</p><p>Participants can ask questions, post comments or even speak during a webinar if they are granted permission, and the presenter can answer questions or explain some aspects of the topic in more detail. Once the session is over, all participants of a webinar receive a video recording so they can rewatch it or go through the parts of the session they’ve missed.</p><h2 id="Part-3-What-is-a-Webinar-Software"><a href="#Part-3-What-is-a-Webinar-Software" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: What is a Webinar Software?"></a>Part 3: What is a Webinar Software?</h2><p>Besides the hardware, you will also need the proper software to set up your first webinar. Even though live streaming is possible without the use of software products that are optimized for webinar creation, most computer programs for production of webinars offer powerful tools that broaden the range of things you can do while broadcasting.</p><p>A well-rounded webinar software enables you to set up a registration page, chat with participants or use pop-up windows that allow attendees to purchase the products or services you’re offering. However, the key ingredient of any powerful webinar software are the metrics tools that let you monitor user engagement and other statistics that are important to the success of your webinars.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134247/18498" target="_top" id="2134247">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134247" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134247/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-4-4-Types-of-Webinars"><a href="#Part-4-4-Types-of-Webinars" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: 4 Types of Webinars"></a>Part 4: 4 Types of Webinars</h2><p>On-demand and live webinars can cover a wide range of topics that have different objectives. Education and promotion are the most common reason to produce a webinar, so here are a few ideas that can help you choose the subject of your first webinar:</p><h4 id="1-Tutorial-Webinar"><a href="#1-Tutorial-Webinar" class="headerlink" title="1. Tutorial Webinar"></a>1. Tutorial Webinar</h4><p>This is probably the most popular type of a webinar because tutorials help people solve problems and accomplish things they struggled with. Your webinars can show viewers how they can perform color grading on their videos, build a dog house for their children or make a delicious ice cream, the options are unlimited. The only prerequisite is to be really good at what you are explaining, since talking about topics you don’t know much about, can hardly lead you to success.</p><h4 id="2-Tech-Training-Webinar"><a href="#2-Tech-Training-Webinar" class="headerlink" title="2. Tech Training Webinar"></a>2. Tech Training Webinar</h4><p>Technology and software are developing at an astounding rate, so most of us are having trouble to keep up with all the latest apps and software products that emerge on the market almost on a daily basis. You can use a webcam, a screen recorder or any type of camera to teach others how to use apps, software or any other modern technology.</p><h4 id="3-Reviews-and-Website-Audits"><a href="#3-Reviews-and-Website-Audits" class="headerlink" title="3. Reviews and Website Audits"></a>3. Reviews and Website Audits</h4><p>A lot of small brands and companies are struggling when it comes to online presentation, which is the reason why creating a webinar that offers in-depth analysis of their blog, website or sales page can prove to be very useful to the participants of your webinars. What’s more, you can offer constructive critique of almost anything, as long as it is relevant to the target group you’re addressing.</p><h4 id="4-Software-Demonstrations"><a href="#4-Software-Demonstrations" class="headerlink" title="4. Software Demonstrations"></a>4. Software Demonstrations</h4><p>Companies that manufacture software as well as individuals who consider themselves experts for a particular software can create webinars that demonstrate how a computer program is used properly. Even the high-end professionals encounter problems while using a software, which means that your audience can include inexperienced and skilled users.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Aspects-Worth-Considering-Before-Choosing-the-Best-Webinar-Software"><a href="#Part-5-Aspects-Worth-Considering-Before-Choosing-the-Best-Webinar-Software" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Aspects Worth Considering Before Choosing the Best Webinar Software"></a>Part 5: Aspects Worth Considering Before Choosing the Best Webinar Software</h2><p>The decision to start producing webinars shouldn’t be taken lightly, because creating a successful webinar is anything but an easy task. You should do everything in your power to approach this task prepared since a simple mistake can ruin a lot of work.</p><h4 id="1-Define-Your-Goals"><a href="#1-Define-Your-Goals" class="headerlink" title="1. Define Your Goals"></a>1. Define Your Goals</h4><p>Being successful requires you to know your goals, so before you start producing webinars you have to define what you want to accomplish and work on it patiently. Masterclasses, One-On-One sessions in which you share your expertise or customer training webinars can all be on the list of your objectives, but you should only make webinars that are directly related to your area of expertise.</p><h4 id="2-Target-Audience"><a href="#2-Target-Audience" class="headerlink" title="2. Target Audience"></a>2. Target Audience</h4><p>Who is your ideal webinar attendee? How old is this person, and where do they live? These are some of the questions that might help you define your target audience and adjust the content of your webinar to the level of skills and knowledge an ideal participant of your webinar has. Knowing who your audience is, will also help you establish a stronger bond with the attendees of the webinars you are producing.</p><h4 id="3-Choose-the-Right-Software"><a href="#3-Choose-the-Right-Software" class="headerlink" title="3. Choose the Right Software"></a>3. Choose the Right Software</h4><p>The type of webinar you want to create will point you in the direction of the best webinar software for the job. Simple online applications like Google + Hangouts or Facebook Live can be a perfect solution if you’re looking for an efficient and easy way to broadcast your content live, but if you are more interested in the production of On-Demand webinars then Zoom or GoToWebinar platforms are a much better choice for you.</p><h4 id="4-Pricing"><a href="#4-Pricing" class="headerlink" title="4. Pricing"></a>4. Pricing</h4><p>Most professional webinar software are expensive, and if you have no intention of using the advanced features they offer, then there is no reason to invest in them. However, if you want to sell products, draw on the screen during a webinar or keep track of the user engagement statistics for each webinar you produce, investing in the right webinar software may prove to be essential for the success of your webinars.</p><h2 id="Part-6-What-Makes-a-Good-Webinar-Software"><a href="#Part-6-What-Makes-a-Good-Webinar-Software" class="headerlink" title="Part 6: What Makes a Good Webinar Software?"></a>Part 6: What Makes a Good Webinar Software?</h2><p>There are a lot of factors that should be taken into consideration when trying to determine whether or not the webinar software meets the industry standards. A good webinar software offers features that make the process of creating a webinar smooth while enabling you to focus on the quality of the content you’re producing. Here are a few options that make a webinar software great.</p><h4 id="1-The-Content-Authoring-Tools"><a href="#1-The-Content-Authoring-Tools" class="headerlink" title="1. The Content Authoring Tools"></a>1. The Content Authoring Tools</h4><p>Setting up webinar registration pages, chatting with the participants of your webinar or selling products during a webinar are just a few among many authoring tools you will need to make your presentations look professional. The webinar software that doesn’t provide a rich selection of content authoring tools may limit your possibilities and reduce the maximum reach a webinar can have.</p><h4 id="2-Integrations-and-Engagement-Tracking-Systems"><a href="#2-Integrations-and-Engagement-Tracking-Systems" class="headerlink" title="2. Integrations and Engagement Tracking Systems"></a>2. Integrations and Engagement Tracking Systems</h4><p>Numbers matter. A scientific approach to webinars will enable you to stay ahead of the competition and to keep track of how well your content is performing. Besides powerful tools for measuring metrics a good webinar software should also offer social media integrations, so you can reach even more people who might be interested in what your webinars have to offer.</p><h4 id="3-Interactivity"><a href="#3-Interactivity" class="headerlink" title="3. Interactivity"></a>3. Interactivity</h4><p>Being able to communicate with your audience, through live chat or video messages and to respond to each question they might have will improve your chances to make a sale or to develop a loyal fan-base that follows each of your webinars. Some webinar hosting platforms allow you to have more than just one speaker, so webinar attendees can share their opinions and feel more involved in the discussion that is taking place.</p><h4 id="4-Branding-or-White-Labeling"><a href="#4-Branding-or-White-Labeling" class="headerlink" title="4. Branding or White Labeling"></a>4. Branding or White Labeling</h4><p>A good webinar software should help you raise brand awareness. You should be able to add logos to everything you offer through your webinars, use the brand’s colors or even include the brand’s promo materials in a webinar. Customizing webinars will help you fans recognize your work, but putting too much accent on the promotion of your brand can come across as too aggressive, so it is important to find the right measure in branding and white labeling.</p><p>Creating webinars is not a complicated process, but it does require preparation. The information we provided above should help you find the right webinar software that will enable you to produce visual content of the highest quality.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139114/17108" target="_top" id="2139114">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139114" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="468" height="60"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139114/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-7-10-Best-Free-and-Commercial-Software-Products-for-Webinars"><a href="#Part-7-10-Best-Free-and-Commercial-Software-Products-for-Webinars" class="headerlink" title="Part 7: 10 Best Free and Commercial Software Products for Webinars"></a>Part 7: 10 Best Free and Commercial Software Products for Webinars</h2><p>Staying ahead of your competition and keeping pace with all the latest technology trends is essential if your goal is to conquer new markets or to lead teams that have great chemistry. Only a few decades ago, it was impossible to hold a conference video call that included more than thirty people, while online training courses were regarded as science fiction. The Internet, webcams, and screen capturing software have changed all this, and today we can easily produce software walk-throughs, eLearning content and a wide variety of video content that enables us to establish strong relationships with potential clients.</p><p>Choosing the webinar software that is capable of meeting all of your demands might be more challenging than it seems because there are thousands of webinar software products available. That’s the reason why we’ve put together the list of the ten best webinar software products, so let’s dive in and explore the premier options for bloggers, entrepreneurs and everyone else who wants to create webinars.</p><table><thead><tr><th>App Name</th><th>Best For</th><th>Pricing</th><th>Platform</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Google + Hangouts</td><td>Corporate communication and non-commercial webinars</td><td>Free</td><td>Web-based, iOS, Android, Windows, Mac</td></tr><tr><td>YouTube Live</td><td>Entrepreneurs who are learning how to create a webinar</td><td>Free</td><td>Web-based, iOS, Android, Windows, Mac</td></tr><tr><td>Facebook Live</td><td>Establishing a better bond with an existing audience on Facebook</td><td>Free</td><td>iOS, Android</td></tr><tr><td>WebinarJam</td><td>Selling products during a webinar, live chat with participants of a webinar</td><td>$39,99 per month</td><td>Web-based, iOS, Android, Windows, Mac</td></tr><tr><td>EverWebinar</td><td>On-Demand Webinars</td><td>$41 per month</td><td>Web-based, iOS, Android, Windows, Mac</td></tr><tr><td>GoToWebinar</td><td>Large marketing teams</td><td>Plans start at $89</td><td>Web-based, iOS, Android, Windows, Mac</td></tr><tr><td>Zoom</td><td>Educators, large companies, marketing teams</td><td>$14,99 per month</td><td>Web-based, iOS, Android, Windows, Mac</td></tr><tr><td>Livestorm</td><td>Analytics oriented marketers</td><td>$99 per month</td><td>Web-based, iOS, Android, Windows, Mac</td></tr><tr><td>ClickMeeting</td><td>In-company meetings, all types of webinars</td><td>Pricing plans start at $25</td><td>Web-based, iOS, Android, Windows, Mac</td></tr><tr><td>GetResponse</td><td>All types of webinars</td><td>Pricing plans start at $49</td><td>Web-based, iOS, Android, Windows, Mac</td></tr></tbody></table><hr><h4 id="1-Google-Hangouts"><a href="#1-Google-Hangouts" class="headerlink" title="1. Google + Hangouts"></a>1. <a class="link"   href="https://hangouts.google.com/" >Google + Hangouts <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Best for:</strong> Corporate communication and non-commercial webinars</p><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p><p>The Google’s product lets you invite as many as thirty participants to a webinar, and if you want, you can also broadcast the webinar on YouTube Stream. All broadcasting sessions are recorded and stored on the YouTube channel you used to broadcast a webinar, and the owner of the channel can make the video private or public. However, the Google + Hangouts app has gone through a lot of changes over the last few years, and on March 9, 2017, Google has announced that it will divide Hangouts into two products, Hangouts Chat and Hangouts Meet.</p><p>Companies that employ large numbers of people often use Google + Hangouts because it enables more than one participant of the webinar to speak and because new members can easily join the webinar. This app isn’t perfectly suited for commercial use since it doesn’t allow you to set a fee for joining the event.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> A great tool for webinars that have a lot of participants, especially if there are several speakers. The app lets you upload webinars to YouTube and share them effortlessly.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Creating paid events or keeping track of the metrics is not on the list of options Google + Hangouts offers, and you need to create an account on Google before you can join a webinar.</p><h4 id="2-YouTube-Live"><a href="#2-YouTube-Live" class="headerlink" title="2. YouTube Live"></a>2. <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/my%5Flive%5Fevents" >YouTube Live <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Best for:</strong> Entrepreneurs who are learning how to create a webinar</p><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p><p>YouTube is the largest online video sharing platform in the world that offers most of its services for free. The YouTube Live feature enables its users to stream live footage captured with screen recording software or webcams and to invite as many viewers to their webinars as they want. Anyone who has a link can join the broadcast, but replying to messages and comments viewers post during a webinar is needlessly complicated.</p><p>Besides, making communication with the participants of a webinar almost impossible, YouTube Live also doesn’t feature a lot of marketing tools that can boost the sales of the products you’re offering. To make things even worse, your broadcasts may have a lag that can be as long as 40 seconds, so paying attention to how you set up your webinars can be crucial for their success.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Easy to use and enables even the most inexperienced vloggers, eLearning content creators, and marketers to produce and share webinars.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Limited interaction with viewers as well as the lack of advanced features for marketing products make YouTube Live only suitable for newcomers to the world of webinars.</p><h4 id="3-Facebook-Live"><a href="#3-Facebook-Live" class="headerlink" title="3. Facebook Live"></a>3. <a class="link"   href="https://apps.facebook.com/livestream/" >Facebook Live <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Best for:</strong> Establishing a better bond with an existing audience on Facebook</p><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p><p>Facebook, like many popular social media networks, has integrated live streaming into the services it provides. Besides enabling you to create webinars, Facebook Live also lets its users produce any other type of live stream, but only with a Smartphone. The conventional webcam method of recording webinars is not available on Facebook Live, and the app doesn’t offer any features for customization of webinars.</p><p>The number of people watching your live stream cannot surpass the number of friends you have on your Facebook account, which means that you can’t use this app to reach new clients. However, if you have a loyal fan-base on this social network, Facebook Live can help you develop a better relationship with people who already follow your work. Even though creating webinars with Facebook Live is possible, professionals will be better off using some more powerful webinar software.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Anyone who has a Facebook account can install and use Facebook Live for free, to capture handheld footage for their webinars.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> No other features besides the live streaming option and you can’t record webinars with a webcam.</p><h4 id="4-WebinarJam"><a href="#4-WebinarJam" class="headerlink" title="4.

WebinarJam also provides features such as pop-ups that let you sell products and services while the webinar is in progress. This and countless other options make WebinarJam platform a perfect tool for marketing teams. Some pricing plans offer you to have up to 3 webinars per month that have five hundred participants, while the content sharing capabilities are nothing short of impressive regardless of the pricing plan you choose.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Makes engaging the audience look easy through a rich selection of powerful tools that enable you to interact with viewers of your webinars.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Pricey, and novice users may experience a steep learning curve</p><h4 id="5-EverWebinar"><a href="#5-EverWebinar" class="headerlink" title="5.

You can tweak the parameters on video quality so that you can get the recording just like you want.</p><p><strong>Webcam Capture</strong> - OBS lets you add webcam as an overlay so that you can record your gameplay as well as show your reaction so that the recording is more interactive and engaging. You can also use green screen setup to make the video more professional and eye-catching.</p><p><strong>Better Audio</strong> - You can record your game sound as well as your voice from external mic. This is useful for voiceover and live commentary to make the video interesting and showcase your personality traits verbally. There are also audio filters, audio mixers, and audio effects available to apply.</p><p><strong>Advanced Editor</strong> - The built-in editing software allows performing different post-recording tasks like sharpening, cropping, and color correction. It has advanced filters that enable Chroma keying, image masking, and color correction.</p><p><strong>Easy Switching</strong> - It comes with a one-click solution for switching between transitions and scenes.

Comparison ShadowPlay vs OBS"></a>Part 2. Comparison ShadowPlay vs OBS</h2><p>Here are the key points of differences between OBS and ShadowPlay that will help you decide between OBS or ShadowPlay.</p><p><strong>ShadowPlay vs OBS</strong> <strong>Recording:</strong></p><p>While recording, OBS allows faster processing of the recorded video files. Besides, it can compress the file size during the encoding process so that the recorded video files take relatively less space. This makes it ideal for longer sessions of gameplay recording. However, in the process, OBS can reduce the frame rate significantly, and hence, the video may not be as smooth as you expect it to be. Therefore, OBS is suitable for regular game recording where not much compression is required.</p><p>On the contrary, ShadowPlay does not reduce the file size or frame rate, and hence, it is a great choice for high-end games where you need the recorded to be as smooth as possible. However, ShadowPlay requires more space on the hard drive. When you upload on video streaming platforms, there will be some automatic compression. Therefore, the less compression you do during your encoding phase, the better will be the output.</p><p><strong>ShadowPlay vs OBS Performance:</strong></p><p>OBS uses significant CPU power and resources. This is one of the reasons why it reduces the frame rate while recording to use less CPU resources. In fact, it can affect the game performance if you are playing and recording a high-end game. However, you can customize various configuration parameters to reduce its burden on CPU performance.</p><p>ShadowPlay does not affect the CPU performance as it comes with hardware acceleration. It supports higher frame rates for high-end games as well. If at all, it can bring about 5%-10% effect on CPU performance which is almost ignorable in comparison to OBS.</p><p><strong>ShadowPlay vs OBS File Format</strong>:</p><p>OBS consumes less space for recorded videos. It compresses the format which can drastically reduce the output file size. The best thing about OBS is that it comes with the NVENC hardware encoded chip that allows choosing from different supported file formats.</p><p>On the contrary, ShadowPlay supports MP4 formats by default which makes it require more space. It uses  codec. MP4 file format is the most popular video file format that you can play across all media players and upload on online platforms.</p><p><strong>ShadowPlay vs OBS Live Streaming</strong>:</p><p>You cannot live stream as well as record on ShadowPlay. This is a major drawback that OBS has overcome. That is why most gamers prefer OBS Studio for live streaming as they can record the gaming session for future reference. If you want to just broadcast your gameplay, ShadowPlay is good enough. But if you want to have multiple scenes and overlay adjustments in live streaming, OBS is the best choice.</p><p><strong>ShadowPlay vs OBS Editing:</strong></p><p>OBS offers better editing options thanks to its built-in editor. Starting customizable transitions to real-time editing before broadcasting, OBS has different editing scopes tailor-made for gamers. On the contrary, ShadowPlay has very limited editing options as the main focus is on recording only. But if we talk about true video editing, both applications are still underdeveloped on this front.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Alternative-Way-To-Record-Games"><a href="#Part-3-Alternative-Way-To-Record-Games" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

Google Meet, Zoom, and Microsoft Teams are free to use, and although they charge for extra functions, there aren’t additional costs for virtual background. We’ve contributed know-how to ensure your guests only focus on you and not what’s behind your back.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/zoom-blur-background.jpg"                      alt="zoom blur background"                ></p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: What to Consider Before Blurring the Background in Zoom?</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: How to Blur the Background in Zoom: A Step-by-Step Guide</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: How to blur the background of any video?</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-What-to-Consider-Before-Blurring-the-Background-in-Zoom"><a href="#Part-1-What-to-Consider-Before-Blurring-the-Background-in-Zoom" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What to Consider Before Blurring the Background in Zoom?"></a><strong>Part 1: What to Consider Before Blurring the Background in Zoom?</strong></h2><p>Zoom can blur everything in the screen’s background with the tap of a button, which can save you from uploading an image to hide your screen’s background. Here’s how to get started before you learn how to blur the background in Zoom.</p><h4 id="1-–-Here-to-look-for-the-blue-background-on-Zoom"><a href="#1-–-Here-to-look-for-the-blue-background-on-Zoom" class="headerlink" title="1 – Here to look for the blue background on Zoom"></a>1 – Here to look for the blue background on Zoom</h4><p>Primarily, make sure that you are looking at your laptop’s Zoom Client. First, open Zoom; tap the <strong>Settings</strong> icon at the top right corner. From there, select “<strong>Backgrounds and Filters</strong>” in the sidebar popup. Then, follow our step-by-step guide to blur Zoom background from there.</p><h4 id="2-–-Update-Zoom-to-get-the-Blur-Background"><a href="#2-–-Update-Zoom-to-get-the-Blur-Background" class="headerlink" title="2 – Update Zoom to get the Blur Background"></a>2 – Update Zoom to get the Blur Background</h4><p>Ensure that the computer system is up to date and supports the latest version of Zoom. To check for updates, tap your profile picture of your <strong>Zoom Desktop Client</strong> at the top-right corner, then scroll down and tap where it says “<strong>Check for Updates</strong>.”</p><p>If you’ve already downloaded the latest version, restart your computer and open Zoom again to see if it shows up.</p><h4 id="3-–-Check-Your-Computer-Requirements"><a href="#3-–-Check-Your-Computer-Requirements" class="headerlink" title="3 – Check Your Computer Requirements"></a>3 – Check Your Computer Requirements</h4><p>Alternatively, you can check for Client and processor requirements. All the information related to requirements compatibility is available on the Zoom help page for virtual background requirements.</p><p>To check the compatibility, go to “<strong>Backgrounds and Filters</strong>“ and uncheck the box that says “<strong>I have a green screen</strong>“ under “<strong>Virtual Backgrounds</strong>.”</p><p>Next, hover over your list of virtual backgrounds. In case you get an error message pointing you need a green screen to support virtual backgrounds, your computer doesn’t support the blur background feature.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068417/7443" target="_top" id="2068417">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068417" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068417/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Blur-the-Background-in-Zoom-A-Step-by-Step-Guide"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Blur-the-Background-in-Zoom-A-Step-by-Step-Guide" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Blur the Background in Zoom: A Step-by-Step Guide"></a><strong>Part 2: How to Blur the Background in Zoom: A Step-by-Step Guide</strong></h2><p>Given below are the ultimate steps on how to blur the background in Zoom via different sections</p><h4 id="Steps-to-Blur-Background-on-Windows-10-before-Zoom-call"><a href="#Steps-to-Blur-Background-on-Windows-10-before-Zoom-call" class="headerlink" title="Steps to Blur Background on Windows 10 before Zoom call"></a>Steps to Blur Background on Windows 10 before Zoom call</h4><p>Steps related to background blur before your Zoom call:</p><ol><li>Install Zoom and log in to your account.</li><li>Click on the “<strong>Settings</strong>“ gear icon option at the top-right corner.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/zoom-settings-tab.jpg"                      alt="zoom settings"                ></p><ol><li>In “Settings,” select “Backgrounds and Filters.”</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/select-zoom-filters.jpg"                      alt="select zoom filters"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135400/19272" target="_top" id="2135400">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135400" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135400/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><ol><li>Then select the “<strong>Blur</strong>” option.

It captures either still pictures or motion videos of users, which can then be uploaded or streamed via the internet. Today, most laptops come with a built-in webcam, embedded into the display. Other webcams are small cameras that either attach to a monitor or sit on a desk and connect to a computer’s USB or FireWire port. Unlike a traditional digital camera, a webcam doesn’t have any built-in storage. Rather a webcam must always be connected to a computer, which it uses for storage.</p><p>In this buyer’s guide, we will introduce the 10 best webcams for your PC or Mac based on your budget and needs.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/logo_icon/wondershare-filmora-logo-horizontal.png"                      alt="Filmora logo"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/common/filmora-product-banner.png"                      alt="filmora product interface"                ></p><h3 id="The-All-in-One-Screen-Recorder-Video-Editor"><a href="#The-All-in-One-Screen-Recorder-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="The All-in-One Screen Recorder &amp; Video Editor"></a>The All-in-One Screen Recorder &amp; Video Editor</h3><ul><li>Record desktop screen, voiceover, and webcam simultaneously</li><li>Edit recorded clips quickly with a wide range of professional tools</li><li>Built-in plentiful templates and effects</li><li>Export to MP4, MOV, MKV, GIF and multiple formats</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static.wondershare.com/images-filmora/images/common/securety.svg"                      alt="secure download"                >Secure Download</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Learn more details about how to record, edit, and produce high-quality webcam videos. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1948932/19272" target="_top" id="1948932">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1948932" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1948932/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Top-10-Best-Webcams-in-2024-for-Different-Purposes-Budgets"><a href="#Top-10-Best-Webcams-in-2024-for-Different-Purposes-Budgets" class="headerlink" title="Top 10 Best Webcams in 2024 for Different Purposes &amp; Budgets"></a>Top 10 Best Webcams in 2024 for Different Purposes &amp; Budgets</h2><h4 id="1-Logitech-C920-The-Best-Overall-Webcam"><a href="#1-Logitech-C920-The-Best-Overall-Webcam" class="headerlink" title="1.

In fact, it has become an equally popular platform among creators and brands as YouTube. That is why creators are willing to upload creative videos and go for live streaming to engage the audiences and get brand deals. You should live stream to Instagram from OBS Studio if you want to stream from your computer.</p><p>Instagram is primarily a mobile app and Instagrammers live stream from their smartphones. However, just like YouTube, you can live stream from your computer if the popular Instagrammers are doing these days. You need OBS Studio which is available for free and it is compatible with Windows, Mac and Linux.

You can live stream on almost any video streaming platform as long as you have the stream URL and stream key. On the other hand, Instagram only allows Instagram Live feature from its app. Therefore, you need a third-party app to obtain the stream URL and stream key so that you can connect OBS Studio with Instagram for live stream.</p><p>There are various third-party apps available to setup OBS Instagram live stream session. We recommend Streamon The application is also available for Windows, Mac and Linux users, just like OBS Studio.
