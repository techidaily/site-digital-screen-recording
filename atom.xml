    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Dusk-to-Dawn-Strategies-for-Exceptional-Night-Portraits"><a href="#Dusk-to-Dawn-Strategies-for-Exceptional-Night-Portraits" class="headerlink" title="Dusk to Dawn: Strategies for Exceptional Night Portraits"></a>Dusk to Dawn: Strategies for Exceptional Night Portraits</h2><p>It has been seen that most portrait photography is carried out during the daytime as this is the time that offers the best light. However, diverging from regular practice can sometimes lead to creative and interesting results.</p><p>Well, <strong>night-mode portraits</strong> can be such an opportunity. However, it can be a little challenging for you. Night portrait shoots require the photographer to manipulate shutter speed, aperture, ISO, and more. Besides, there are certain dos and don’ts that you also need to keep in mind. Keep reading to know more about this.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/night-potraits.jpg"                      alt="night potraits"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Must-Dos-in-Night-Portraits"><a href="#Part-1-Must-Dos-in-Night-Portraits" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Must-Dos in Night Portraits"></a>Part 1: Must-Dos in Night Portraits</h2><p>Let’s start this discussion by exploring the major dos related to <strong>night portraits</strong> photoshoots. Some dos that you should consider are:</p><h3 id="1-Shooting-with-a-topic"><a href="#1-Shooting-with-a-topic" class="headerlink" title="1. Shooting with a topic"></a>1. Shooting with a topic</h3><p>One of the most difficult repercussions of <strong>night mode portraits</strong> is that everything in your sight takes on a strange appeal, which can easily make it challenging to understand the composition and picture subject. Well, to avoid such an issue, you need to make yourself familiarized with your topic or subject. So, you can arrive at the location before sunset and begin the setup procedure.</p><p>This will also allow you to take advantage of clicking pictures during special hour lighting. Besides, it will also help you to know how changing list settings can affect the scene. Another important thing to consider here is styling your subject. You need to make sure that your subjects look professional and choose the right type of clothing. So, try to understand the purpose of your <strong>night mode portraits.</strong></p><h3 id="2-Lighting-your-Subject"><a href="#2-Lighting-your-Subject" class="headerlink" title="2. Lighting your Subject"></a>2. Lighting your Subject</h3><p>While shooting <strong>night portraits,</strong> based on the location, you may not get sufficient natural light to light up the subject. This is where you need to use some types of artificial lighting. Without this, you may not be able to capture the details of your subject. Your shots will look very blurry and underexposed. Well, artificial lighting need not be a flash. The source of artificial lighting can be anything.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/pexels-matheus-bertelli-573298.jpg"                      alt="pexels matheus bertelli 573298"                ></p><p>For example, it can be a car light, a phone flashlight, a billboard light and anything that can light up the subject, offering a decent amount of illumination to your camera. Make sure that the light is accessible. Experts suggest using off-camera flashlights for <strong>night portraits</strong> as it offers better flexibility. Based on your requirements, you can adjust the direction and brightness. Using a light stand can also be very helpful here.</p><h3 id="3-Make-Good-Use-of-Night-Mode-Portrait"><a href="#3-Make-Good-Use-of-Night-Mode-Portrait" class="headerlink" title="3. Make Good Use of Night Mode Portrait"></a>3. Make Good Use of Night Mode Portrait</h3><p>Don’t forget to take advantage of your camera’s night mode portrait option to get stunning results. Sometimes, you need to depend on software instead of your camera’s hardware for better results. Post-processing can enhance the exposure, level colors, effectively tune white balance, etc., and night mode can help you with that. When you choose this option, the camera will consider different factors, like the movement of the subjects, camera, light settings and more.</p><p>The camera will then take a series of photos at multiple exposure levels and then merge them to create a single image with great details. Even though <strong>night mode portraits</strong> can help you a lot, they may not work well while taking photos of moving objects. The reason behind this is that this mode takes multiple shots, and moving subjects would be blurred out. If it is a static scene, then go for it.</p><h3 id="4-Shooting-with-a-Stabilizer"><a href="#4-Shooting-with-a-Stabilizer" class="headerlink" title="4. Shooting with a Stabilizer"></a>4. Shooting with a Stabilizer</h3><p>For better results, you can use a camera stabilizer. A camera stabilizer will offer you the ability to take beautiful and smooth shots while moving. Stabilizers come in different configurations and sizes. They can effectively lower the vibration of the camera while moving. But shooting with a monopod, gimbal, or other rigs can be a little challenging for you. However, there are some tips that you can keep in your mind for better results, for example:</p><ul><li>Always try to maintain a perfect distance from the subject.</li><li>Use wheels.</li><li>You can also use electronic panning.</li><li>Walk carefully.</li><li>Close down the aperture.</li><li>Allow your subject to move into the focus distance.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/pexels-marcelo-dias-1970482.jpg"                      alt="pexels marcelo dias 1970482"                ></p><p>Experts suggest using a sturdy camera tripod, and it will be better to get a remote release. With this, you can trigger the camera without touching the shutter button, and it will reduce the movement of the camera.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Don’t-Dos-in-Night-Portraits"><a href="#Part-2-Don’t-Dos-in-Night-Portraits" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Don’t-Dos in Night Portraits"></a>Part 2: Don’t-Dos in Night Portraits</h2><h3 id="1-Don’t-dress-in-dark"><a href="#1-Don’t-dress-in-dark" class="headerlink" title="1. Don’t dress in dark"></a>1. Don’t dress in dark</h3><p>When it comes to wearing black for night portraits, experts suggest avoiding it unless you have proper light settings and you have your make-up done by an expert who can correct the color for shadows. Sometimes, dark clothes may create an aging effect on the subject. Besides, if the lighting condition is not good, the photos will become much darker due to your dark dress. So, wear light-colored dresses. Besides, don’t use shirts that have visible text, brand names or logos.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/pexels-nikolai-ulltang-572463.jpg"                      alt="pexels nikolai ulltang 572463"                ></p><h3 id="2-Don’t-do-a-capture-shoot"><a href="#2-Don’t-do-a-capture-shoot" class="headerlink" title="2. Don’t do a capture shoot"></a>2. Don’t do a capture shoot</h3><p>Most photographers use single shooting mode or go for the capture shoot in many cases. That could be the manual mode, and sometimes it is done to adjust the shutter and aperture manually. During night shooting, some photographers use higher ISO. This means the lens will allow more light to come in. As a result, it can create a smear while capturing a moving object. But in some cases, using continuous shooting can help you to capture some of the best moments for <strong>night portraits.</strong> If you are shooting in a fast-paced scenario, then this can help you a lot. You may not use all the images you have captured, but you can find perfect portraits.</p><h3 id="3-Don’t-Overuse-Light-The-Right-Shutter-Speed-ISO-and-Aperture"><a href="#3-Don’t-Overuse-Light-The-Right-Shutter-Speed-ISO-and-Aperture" class="headerlink" title="3. Don’t Overuse Light- The Right Shutter Speed, ISO and Aperture"></a>3. Don’t Overuse Light- The Right Shutter Speed, ISO and Aperture</h3><p>Another thing you need to avoid here is the overuse of light. You need to work on the primary exposure settings, i.e., the ISO, aperture and shutter speed. You should keep in mind that these three configurations will create exposure and influence the photos’ overall brightness. One thing to consider while choosing the setting is to have a photo with a lot of detail in the mid-tones, highlights, and shadows.</p><p>When you overuse the light, it can affect the scene’s depth of field. Besides, the sharpness of the subject will also get affected by this. To control the light, you need to choose the aperture based on the depth of field. For example, for a shallow effect, you can go for a wide aperture, like f&#x2F;2.8. You can use a narrower aperture, like f&#x2F;8, for a sharper background.</p><p>Talking about the shutter speed, for stationary subjects, you can go for 1&#x2F;160s. If it is a moving subject, then 1&#x2F;500s or above can work for you. Now, coming to the ISO, the default ISO value, i.e., ISO 100, is good for taking the highest-quality photos. If you think your portraits are overexposed, then increase the shutter speed to control the light.</p><h3 id="4-Don’t-forget-about-white-balance-and-Adjust-It-Before-Shooting"><a href="#4-Don’t-forget-about-white-balance-and-Adjust-It-Before-Shooting" class="headerlink" title="4. Don’t forget about white balance and Adjust It Before Shooting"></a>4. Don’t forget about white balance and Adjust It Before Shooting</h3><p>Speaking about white balance, it is a setting to make sure the colors in the photos are natural and accurate and the photos don’t have unrealistic colors. If the subject appears white in real but blue or red in the photos, then you need to adjust the white balance. Daylight white balance will be very warm for night photos. That’s why you need to go for cooler settings, around 3200 to 4800, based on your environment and location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/pexels-simon-robben-473107.jpg"                      alt="pexels simon robben 473107"                ></p><p>For example, in city areas, a lower setting, i.e., 3400 to 3900k, can work great. On the other hand, for darker skies, white balance settings of 4000k and above will offer you the best results. Begin with the above suggestion and click some test photos while increasing 100k after every shot to find the right white balance settings.</p><p>However, you can also preset the white balance in your camera or edit the photos during post-processing to adjust the white balance. For example, you can use color correction to fix colors. Using this, you can make the photos look brighter or darker to make them appear natural and realistic. Always use a vector scope to make sure that your colors are accurate.</p><h2 id="FAQs"><a href="#FAQs" class="headerlink" title="FAQs"></a>FAQs</h2><h3 id="How-To-Capture-Good-Portraits-at-Night"><a href="#How-To-Capture-Good-Portraits-at-Night" class="headerlink" title="How To Capture Good Portraits at Night?"></a>How To Capture Good Portraits at Night?</h3><p>As per the experts, the lower the aperture, the more light your camera will receive. This can make your <strong>night mode portraits</strong> difficult. So, you need to go for a slower shutter speed and make sure that there will be subject or camera movement. All you need to do is control the light.</p><h3 id="What-Should-You-Need-to-Avoid-in-Portrait-Photography"><a href="#What-Should-You-Need-to-Avoid-in-Portrait-Photography" class="headerlink" title="What Should You Need to Avoid in Portrait Photography?"></a>What Should You Need to Avoid in Portrait Photography?</h3><p>Some common mistakes that you need to avoid while shooting portraits are poor lighting, poor composition, bad background, using the incorrect lens, not properly focusing on the eyes, overexposure and more. Just follow the above-mentioned tips to get stunning night portraits.</p><h3 id="What-Are-the-Best-Camera-Settings-for-Night-Photography"><a href="#What-Are-the-Best-Camera-Settings-for-Night-Photography" class="headerlink" title="What Are the Best Camera Settings for Night Photography?"></a>What Are the Best Camera Settings for Night Photography?</h3><p>You should use your camera in manual mode. Besides, utilizing long camera shutter speeds, around 30 seconds to 60 seconds, will be good. Sometimes, using auto-white balance, you can get great results. The experts also suggest keeping the aperture around f&#x2F;11 and going for a low ISO, between 100 to 200.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-comprehensive-guide-to-screenshot-excellence/"><u>2024 Approved  The Comprehensive Guide to Screenshot Excellence</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/future-proofing-filmmaking-with-green-tools-for-2024/"><u>Future-Proofing Filmmaking with Green Tools for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-dynamic-background-adaptation-in-microsoft-teams-beforeafter-calls/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Dynamic Background Adaptation in Microsoft Teams Before/After Calls</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-storage-solutions-ps5s-top-10-external-units/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Storage Solutions  PS5's Top 10 External Units</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-unlocking-the-potential-of-ez-grabber/"><u>[New] In 2024, Unlocking the Potential of EZ Grabber</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-high-definition-recordings-picking-the-best-frame-rate-wisely/"><u>[Updated] High-Definition Recordings  Picking the Best Frame Rate Wisely</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-basic-procedures-for-saving-screen-talks-for-2024/"><u>[New] Basic Procedures for Saving Screen Talks for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fake-location.techidaily.com/does-airplane-mode-turn-off-gps-location-on-samsung-galaxy-s23plus-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Does Airplane Mode Turn off GPS Location On Samsung Galaxy S23+? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/how-to-restore-a-bricked-samsung-galaxy-a05s-back-to-operation-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>How To Restore a Bricked Samsung Galaxy A05s Back to Operation | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-2-ways-to-monitor-oppo-reno-10-pro-5g-activity-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, 2 Ways to Monitor Oppo Reno 10 Pro 5G Activity | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/new-how-to-craft-engaging-narratives-for-facebook-reels/"><u>[New] How to Craft Engaging Narratives for Facebook Reels</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/captureitease-2023s-best-screen-recording-tools-for-2024/"><u>CaptureItEase  2023'S Best Screen Recording Tools for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/minimizing-movement-blur-in-media-for-2024/"><u>Minimizing Movement Blur in Media for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/new-earning-potential-for-videos-amassing-1-million-views-for-2024/"><u>[New] Earning Potential for Videos Amassing 1 Million Views for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/blur-borders-for-visual-privacy/"><u>Blur Borders for Visual Privacy</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fake-location.techidaily.com/prevent-cross-site-tracking-on-lenovo-thinkphone-and-browser-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Prevent Cross-Site Tracking on Lenovo ThinkPhone and Browser | Dr.fone</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Enhance-Visuals-with-Better-OBS-Settings"><a href="#Enhance-Visuals-with-Better-OBS-Settings" class="headerlink" title="Enhance Visuals with Better OBS Settings"></a>Enhance Visuals with Better OBS Settings</h2><p>When you are live streaming through OBS Studio, encoding the video takes a lot of CPU resources. If you do not have a high-end computer, you are likely to face Encoding Overloaded issue while using OBS Studio. High encoding problem is rather common in OBS Studio because video recording and streaming demand high system resources which your computer is unable to meet.</p><p>In layman’s terms, encoding overloading means your hardware is just not running as fast as required to process the video you are streaming or recording. Since you cannot change your hardware configuration overnight, here are the different ways you can fix OBS high encoding when streaming.</p><h2 id="Way-1-Downscale-Your-Output-Resolution"><a href="#Way-1-Downscale-Your-Output-Resolution" class="headerlink" title="Way 1. Downscale Your Output Resolution"></a>Way 1. Downscale Your Output Resolution</h2><p>The higher the resolution of the video recording or streaming, the greater will be the CPU usage. This is because your processor has to process more number of pixels per frame. That is why you have to lower the output resolution of your video. Even when your base resolution is high, you have to cut down the output resolution. Base resolution is the resolution of the video at source which could be the game you are playing. The output resolution is the resolution of the video you are getting after recording or you are streaming in real-time. Here are the steps to follow.</p><p>Step 1: Open OBS and go to Settings.</p><p>Step 2: Select Video tab. You will have to look for Output (Scaled) Resolution option.</p><p>Step 3: You have to reduce the resolution from the current resolution. If it is at 1920 x 1080p, you have to bring it down to 1280 x 720p.</p><p>Step 4: Click on Apply and Ok buttons. Restart your computer and start streaming or recording again.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-reduce-the-output-resolution.jpg"                      alt="obs reduce the output resolution"                ></p><h2 id="Way-2-Lower-Your-Frame-Rate"><a href="#Way-2-Lower-Your-Frame-Rate" class="headerlink" title="Way 2. Lower Your Frame Rate"></a>Way 2. Lower Your Frame Rate</h2><p>The frame rate of a video determines the number of frames captured per second. The higher the frame rate, the greater will be the pressure on GPU to render more number of frames per second. Unless you have a powerful configuration, you will come across OBS high encoding when streaming if the frame rate is high such as 60FPS. Here are the steps to lower the frame rate of your video on OBS.</p><p>Step 1: Launch OBS and go to Settings.</p><p>Step 2: Go to Video tab and look for Common FPS Values option.</p><p>Step 3: If it is set to 60, you have to bring it down to 30. Basically, you have to reduce the current value.</p><p>Step 4: Click on Apply and Ok button to save the new setting. Restart your computer and resume your OBS operation.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-click-on-apply-and-ok-button.jpg"                      alt="obs click on apply and ok button"                ></p><h2 id="Way-3-Change-Encoder-Preset"><a href="#Way-3-Change-Encoder-Preset" class="headerlink" title="Way 3. Change Encoder Preset"></a>Way 3. Change Encoder Preset</h2><p>By default, OBS uses x264 as encoder and the encoder preset is set to “veryfast”. This is generally the best and most balanced setting. However, if you are getting OBS high encoding warning, you have to change the encoder preset to reduce the CPU usage. Generally, the higher the preset, the lower is CPU usage. Therefore, you have to set the preset from “veryfast” to “ultrafast” and here are the steps.</p><p>Step 1: Launch OBS and go to Settings.</p><p>Step 2: Go to Output tab and make sure that the encoder is Software(x264).</p><p>Step 3: Turn on Enable Advanced Encoder Settings option.</p><p>Step 4: Change the Encoder Preset from Veryfast to Ultrafast.</p><p>Step 5: Click on Apply and Ok button. Restart your computer and perform your action on OBS.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-change-encoder-preset.jpg"                      alt="obs change encoder preset"                ></p><h2 id="Way-4-Try-Hardware-Encoding"><a href="#Way-4-Try-Hardware-Encoding" class="headerlink" title="Way 4. Try Hardware Encoding"></a>Way 4. Try Hardware Encoding</h2><p>You can try out different hardware encoders available such as Quicksync, AMF, or NVENC. The availability of different hardware encoders depends on your computer hardware configuration. These hardware encoders are better than the default x264 encoder as they use less CPU resources. Since the issue is primarily with encoder, you should try changing the encoder and see if the problem is fixed.</p><p>Step 1: On OBS, you will have to go to Settings.</p><p>Step 2: Select Output tab and set Output Mode to Advanced.</p><p>Step 3: Go to Streaming tab, and check all the encoders available.</p><p>Step 4: Change the encoder from default x264 to any other hardware encoder available.</p><p>Step 5: Click on Apply and Ok to save the settings. Restart your computer and perform your operation on OBS.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-restart-your-computer-and-perform-your-operation.jpg"                      alt="obs restart your computer and perform your operation"                ></p><h2 id="Way-5-Change-Some-Advanced-Settings"><a href="#Way-5-Change-Some-Advanced-Settings" class="headerlink" title="Way 5. Change Some Advanced Settings"></a>Way 5. Change Some Advanced Settings</h2><p>If you are still facing OBS high encoding problem, you need to change some advanced settings in order to fix this encoder overloaded issue. You can change the keyframe interval so that your processor gets enough time for rendering. Similarly, you can change Rate Control from Constant to Variable so that the video does not demand high bandwidth.</p><p>Step 1: Open OBS and go to Settings.</p><p>Step 2: Go to Output tab and set Output Mode as Advanced.</p><p>Step 3: From Streaming tab, change Keyframe Interval and set it to 2 from zero.</p><p>Step 4: Change Rate Control from CBR to VBR.</p><p>Step 5: Change Profile from None to Main.</p><p>Step 6: Click on Apply and Ok button to save the changes. Restart your computer and check if the problem is resolved.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-open-and-go-to-settings.jpg"                      alt="obs open and go to settings"                ></p><h2 id="Way-6-Use-OBS-Alternative"><a href="#Way-6-Use-OBS-Alternative" class="headerlink" title="Way 6. Use OBS Alternative"></a>Way 6. Use OBS Alternative</h2><p>If none of the above-mentioned ways can solve the constant encoding overloaded warning you are receiving while using OBS Studio for recording or streaming, you have to opt for an alternative. Wondershare Filmora is the best alternative to OBS for recording screen and webcam. Filmora does not affect the CPU performance as significantly as OBS Studio does. That is why the encoding overloaded issue is unlikely to occur in Filmora.</p><p>Filmora is one of the most popular video recorders that come with inbuilt video editor. You can record your screen, gameplay as well as webcam along with audio from different sources.

Although Microsoft is in the process of making the feature available for all devices, no official statement has been released by them to date.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Commanders’-Clash-The-Ultimate-Ranking-of-7-Total-War-Games"><a href="#Commanders’-Clash-The-Ultimate-Ranking-of-7-Total-War-Games" class="headerlink" title="Commanders’ Clash: The Ultimate Ranking of 7 Total War Games"></a>Commanders’ Clash: The Ultimate Ranking of 7 Total War Games</h2><p>It’s a tough task to choose the best total war games. Everyone has a favorite—the game that first introduced them to the series or allowed them to immerse themselves in a historical era they’d always been fascinated with. When you find a historical era you didn’t even know much about, as I did through Shogun 2 &amp; Three Kingdoms, it sparks your interest.</p><p>Warhammer 3 introduces survival combat, a fresh Three Kingdoms game is announced, Saga: Troy tries mythology on it for size, the franchise is expanding in more ways than ever before. Classics, though, are still available. One of the most compelling aspects is that, despite their differences, they all have a sense of cohesiveness. You can dive into anything and always find something in common.</p><p>For many individuals, Total War has a special place in their hearts, and it’s always enjoyable to go back and play games from the series whenever the mood strikes. I’m constantly attracted back to films like Attila, Fall of the Samurai, and Rome 2, to name a few. Regardless of whatever one you favor, they all provide a similar combination of struggle and failure, conquest, and dominance.</p><p>The Best Total War games on their own are listed here.</p><h3 id="1-Attila-the-Hun"><a href="#1-Attila-the-Hun" class="headerlink" title="1.Attila the Hun"></a>1.Attila the Hun</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/attila-the-hun-poster.png"                      alt="attila-the-hun-poster"                ></p><p>Napoleon aspired to be Attila the Hun. At the time of its release, Attila’s primary goal was to fix Rome 2’s flaws and stripped-down features, since it seemed like the game was going down the same road as Empire. Attila, on the other hand, proved to be more than that, because it not only reintroduced promised features but also innovated, iterated, and expanded the brand.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Dramatic perspective.</p><p>• Ominous franchise.</p><h3 id="2-Rome-2-Total-War"><a href="#2-Rome-2-Total-War" class="headerlink" title="2.Rome 2 Total War"></a>2.Rome 2 Total War</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/rome-2-total-war-poster.png"                      alt="rome-2-total-war-poster"                ></p><p>Unlike its predecessor, Rome 2, which was released in 2004, the time has been very kind with Rome 2 &amp;, as a consequence, it may be called a surprise success for CA. Rome 2 had a disastrous debut, similar to Empire, and it took a year for it to become genuinely playable. CA, on the other hand, stuck it out and won their first genuine AAA Total War.</p><p>Apart from the largely forgotten rough launch problems and many contentious design choices, Rome 2 has left an unresolved black stain on the Total War series that still exists today: chronic feature stripping, particularly in multiplayer. Regardless, Rome 2 is a fascinating revisit to Ancient Rome, though it took a long time to get there—after all, Rome was not built in a day.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Gore &amp; Blood.</p><p>• State of Greek culture pack.</p><p>• Raider and Pirates culture pack.</p><h3 id="3-Three-Kingdoms-Total-War"><a href="#3-Three-Kingdoms-Total-War" class="headerlink" title="3.Three Kingdoms: Total War"></a>3.Three Kingdoms: Total War</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/three-kingdom-total-war-poster.jpg"                      alt="three-kingdom-total-war-poster"                ></p><p>Three Kingdoms has been the most recent mainline of the best total war games, and in my opinion, it’s also the most honest. The game devotes itself entirely to a dramatized, idealized, and cinematic depiction in Ancient Chinese history (the first in the series), relying mainly on the Love rather than the Three Kingdoms Records. I wouldn’t be shocked if the upcoming best total war games took a more hands-on approach.</p><p>However, there are several flaws with it. Unfortunately, the tactical layer continues to be hampered by the simpler Thrones of Brittania’s financial and building system, and the campaign is poorly paced owing to the campaign map’s sheer vastness and stretched-out primary goals. The most serious problem is the absence of multiplayer service and support. Even though here is where CA may locate gold, it was almost dead when it arrived. Three Kingdoms is, in the end, a sprawling, rich, and thrilling retelling of a violent era in Chinese history.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Focused on character.</p><p>• Story and setting.</p><p>• Diplomacy.</p><h3 id="4-Total-War-Saga-Samurai-Fall"><a href="#4-Total-War-Saga-Samurai-Fall" class="headerlink" title="4.Total War Saga: Samurai Fall"></a>4.Total War Saga: Samurai Fall</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/total-war-saga-samurai-fall.jpg"                      alt="total-war-saga-samurai-fall"                ></p><p>Ironically, the greatest Saga game was never intended to be a Saga game. Fall of the Samurai (later renamed as a Saga game) was released as a standalone addition for Shogun 2, transporting players to the lesser-known Meiji Restoration era in Japanese history, when pro-Imperial and pro-Shogunate armies fought for Japan’s destiny.</p><p>As close-quarters oriented samurai fight against and besides modern firearms-equipped soldiers, the campaign’s theme of tradition vs. modernity creates intriguing combat dynamics. This gives the tactical gameplay a fascinating twist and complexity that matches Shogun 2’s meticulous balance. The fall of the Samurai is certainly worth checking out as a historical development and improvement of Shogun 2.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Dramatic Clash.</p><p>• Modern weaponry.</p><p>• Explosive power.</p><h3 id="5-Warhammer-2"><a href="#5-Warhammer-2" class="headerlink" title="5.Warhammer 2"></a>5.Warhammer 2</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/warhammer2-poster.jpg"                      alt="warhammer2-poster"                ></p><p>With a stronger narrative emphasis and more engaging factions and systems, Warhammer 2 builds on the original’s legacy and influence of the best total war games series.</p><p>Warhammer 2 has all of the features that made Warhammer so popular, as well as tweaks to the balance and additional post-release material and updates. The Mortal Empires’ adventure, which merges the strategic landscapes from the first and two seasons into one huge super campaign, is perhaps Warhammer 2’s most significant feature. However, as a result of this, Warhammer 2 swallows the first, rendering Warhammer insignificant as a gaming experience.</p><p>This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for any Warhammer enthusiast. What’s also cool to see, particularly in the post-launch support, is that both CA &amp; Games Workshop put out the effort to create new components, whether they’re units, heroes, or mythology, and add them to the games, indicating a real interest in using this framework for franchise development. The multiplayer in Warhammer 2 is also very strong, although this is due more to a large number of generally well-defined and realized factions and races than to any specific improvements in the mode.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Real time tactics.</p><p>• Strategy based.</p><p>• AI controlled factions.</p><h3 id="6-Total-War-Medieval-2"><a href="#6-Total-War-Medieval-2" class="headerlink" title="6.Total War Medieval 2"></a>6.Total War Medieval 2</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/total-war-medieval-2-poster.jpg"                      alt="total-war-medieval-2-poster"                ></p><p>These last two entries are almost interchangeable since they are both excellent examples of best total war games, but because this is a ranking list, I’ll offer a specific response. Medieval 2 is essentially the same game as Medieval 1, but with improved visuals, updated gameplay, and additional features. Who’d have guessed that would suffice?</p><p>Of course, Medieval 2 has many of the same flaws as Rome, such as bad AI and pathfinding, but because there was no remake, it remains a game set in its period that is still remarkable even when compared with some of the most recent best total war games.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Campaign mode.</p><p>• Battle focused.</p><h3 id="7-Shogun-2-Total-War"><a href="#7-Shogun-2-Total-War" class="headerlink" title="7.Shogun 2: Total War"></a>7.Shogun 2: Total War</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shogun2-total-war-poster.jpg"                      alt="shogun2-total-war-poster"                ></p><p>Finally, the apex of Total War, the meeting point and turning point among older and newer era Total Wars, and the example of Creative Assemblies at its height. While Shogun 2 isn’t exactly a AAA cost game (I’d call it an AA or AA.5), it has the feel of one. Even though Shogun 2 lacks some of the previous games’ large landscapes or faction variety, the general performance of the gameplay and features that interact with one another, as well as several quality-of-life improvements, making it the finest game within the list of best total war games.</p><p>The inclusion of the Avatar Invasion multiplayer mode was Shogun 2’s biggest success, but it was not as busy or famous as that at launch. The game’s already high quality in the tactical campaign and battles, coupled with a genuinely unique multiplayer structure, demonstrate that there is a happy medium between keeping what works and introducing something new. Total Wars in the modern era have failed to achieve the same heights as Shogun 2. This game is recommended not only as a fantastic Total War game, but as a fantastic strategy game that will go down in history.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Chosokabe Clan.</p><p>• Army lead.</p><p>• Even beginners can benefit from these tutorials.</p><h4 id="Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Wondershare Filmora"></a>Wondershare Filmora</h4><p>Get started easily with Filmora’s powerful performance, intuitive interface, and countless effects!</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Learn More &gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://neveragain.allstatics.com/2019/assets/image/box/filmora-9.png"                                     ></p><p>Napoleon aspired to be Attila the Hun.

Users may meet face to face, communicate with associates via in-meeting chatting or conference call, &amp; share their presentations via screen sharing.</p><p>Meetings may be accessed via a PC, Mac, iOS, or Android device. All GoToMeeting sessions (also known as webinars) can be recorded.

How to Record in GoToMeeting with Built-in Recorder</h2><p>Meetings can be recorded using the built-in <strong>gotomeeting recording</strong> option, but there are limits.</p><p>However, recording options must be set up before the commencement of the session. You can only record meetings using GoToMeeting’s meeting recorder if you have a premium account and admin authorization, making it a much less convenient option to record meetings.</p><p>Step 1.

While recording, click “Start Your Recording,” and the “REC” icon will become red. The recording of the meeting will be announced to all participants.</p><p>Step 3. Click over the “REC” icon and choose “Stop Your Recording” to stop the recording. If you’re making a local recording, the Recording Manager will open up and ask you to convert the video. However, if you’re doing a cloud recording, you’ll be sent to your online account to retrieve the footage. It takes some time for new recordings to appear in the cloud recording history.</p><p>Step 4. However, what if other participants, such as not account owners or organizers, wish to record live sessions? In this instance, you’ll need a video-recording program that works on both PCs and Macs.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Use-the-Best-GoToMeeting-Recorder-on-PC"><a href="#Part-2-Use-the-Best-GoToMeeting-Recorder-on-PC" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Comparative-Game-Capture-Review-OBS-Vs-ShadowPlay"><a href="#Comparative-Game-Capture-Review-OBS-Vs-ShadowPlay" class="headerlink" title="Comparative Game Capture Review: OBS Vs. ShadowPlay"></a>Comparative Game Capture Review: OBS Vs. ShadowPlay</h2><p>If you are an avid gamer and you are not recording your gameplay and uploading on online platforms, you are missing out on the trend. Gamers are uploading their gameplay on video streaming platforms like Twitch and YouTube and earning followers, fame as well as money. No matter which game you play on your computer, you should record it. Thereafter, you can make it interesting with editing and voiceover and upload on video streaming and social media platforms.</p><p>Primarily, you will need a gameplay recording software and there is no dearth of gameplay and screen recording software. The two most popular free gameplay recorders are OBS Studio and ShadowPlay. In order to help you choose OBS or ShadowPlay, we have provided you with a complete comparison of ShadowPlay vs OBS recording software. Go through all the points minutely and understand their differences and pick the perfect one for recording your gameplay.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Key-Features-of-OBS-and-ShadowPlay"><a href="#Part-1-Key-Features-of-OBS-and-ShadowPlay" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Key Features of OBS and ShadowPlay"></a>Part 1. Key Features of OBS and ShadowPlay</h2><p>OBS and ShadowPlay are both completely free to use for recording your gameplay as well as your capturing desktop screen. OBS is open-source software and it has a cross-platform structure which is why it supports all computer operating systems. It is popular among gamers for live streaming on Twitch and YouTube.</p><p>ShadowPlay comes from Nvidia which is the largest manufacturer for GPU. That is why gamers who prefer Nvidia GPU, they have a special preference for ShadowPlay. Here are the key features of OBS and ShadowPlay you should be aware of.</p><h3 id="OBS-Studio"><a href="#OBS-Studio" class="headerlink" title="OBS Studio"></a>OBS Studio</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/record-sims4-obs.jpg"                      alt="obs studio"                ></p><p><strong>Screen Capture</strong> - You can capture high-quality gameplay when you play games on your computer as well as on a gaming console. You can tweak the parameters on video quality so that you can get the recording just like you want.</p><p><strong>Webcam Capture</strong> - OBS lets you add webcam as an overlay so that you can record your gameplay as well as show your reaction so that the recording is more interactive and engaging. You can also use green screen setup to make the video more professional and eye-catching.</p><p><strong>Better Audio</strong> - You can record your game sound as well as your voice from external mic. This is useful for voiceover and live commentary to make the video interesting and showcase your personality traits verbally. There are also audio filters, audio mixers, and audio effects available to apply.</p><p><strong>Advanced Editor</strong> - The built-in editing software allows performing different post-recording tasks like sharpening, cropping, and color correction. It has advanced filters that enable Chroma keying, image masking, and color correction.</p><p><strong>Easy Switching</strong> - It comes with a one-click solution for switching between transitions and scenes. The tool can be perfect for going back and forth between games and devices. You can also add multiple screens and audio sources as required.</p><p>Most importantly, you can live stream your gameplay on almost any online video streaming platform.</p><h3 id="Nvidia-ShadowPlay"><a href="#Nvidia-ShadowPlay" class="headerlink" title="Nvidia ShadowPlay"></a>Nvidia ShadowPlay</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shadowplay-record.jpg"                      alt="shadowplay"                ></p><p><strong>Gameplay Capture</strong> - ShadowPlay lets you record gameplay at 8K with 30FPS. This is unmatched by any free video recording software. You can also record gameplay at 4K HDR with 60FPS. It comes with hardware acceleration to ensure the performance does not get affected while recording in the background.</p><p><strong>Instant Replay</strong> - ShadowPlay keeps recording in the background and therefore, if something important has happened in the game, you can get the last 30 seconds of instant replay clip and you can share it anywhere you want. This is highly useful to share short clips on social media platforms.</p><p><strong>ShadowPlay Highlights</strong> - The feature will automatically record the best gaming moments and create a perfect highlight video. This is useful when you want to upload the best parts of the gameplay rather than the entire part.</p><p><strong>Screenshots</strong> - ShadowPlay lets you capture 8K screenshots of your game that you can use as thumbnails for your videos as well as put them up on social media platforms.</p><p><strong>GIF Creator</strong> - With ShadowPlay, you don’t have to leave the game to create GIFs. You can create high-quality GIFs of duration 15 seconds. You can also add text to the GIFs and share anything you want.</p><p>Just like OBS, ShadowPlay enables you to broadcast gameplay in real-time on YouTube Live, Twitch, and Facebook Live.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Comparison-ShadowPlay-vs-OBS"><a href="#Part-2-Comparison-ShadowPlay-vs-OBS" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Comparison ShadowPlay vs OBS"></a>Part 2. Comparison ShadowPlay vs OBS</h2><p>Here are the key points of differences between OBS and ShadowPlay that will help you decide between OBS or ShadowPlay.</p><p><strong>ShadowPlay vs OBS</strong> <strong>Recording:</strong></p><p>While recording, OBS allows faster processing of the recorded video files. Besides, it can compress the file size during the encoding process so that the recorded video files take relatively less space. This makes it ideal for longer sessions of gameplay recording. However, in the process, OBS can reduce the frame rate significantly, and hence, the video may not be as smooth as you expect it to be. Therefore, OBS is suitable for regular game recording where not much compression is required.</p><p>On the contrary, ShadowPlay does not reduce the file size or frame rate, and hence, it is a great choice for high-end games where you need the recorded to be as smooth as possible. However, ShadowPlay requires more space on the hard drive. When you upload on video streaming platforms, there will be some automatic compression. Therefore, the less compression you do during your encoding phase, the better will be the output.</p><p><strong>ShadowPlay vs OBS Performance:</strong></p><p>OBS uses significant CPU power and resources. This is one of the reasons why it reduces the frame rate while recording to use less CPU resources. In fact, it can affect the game performance if you are playing and recording a high-end game. However, you can customize various configuration parameters to reduce its burden on CPU performance.</p><p>ShadowPlay does not affect the CPU performance as it comes with hardware acceleration. It supports higher frame rates for high-end games as well. If at all, it can bring about 5%-10% effect on CPU performance which is almost ignorable in comparison to OBS.</p><p><strong>ShadowPlay vs OBS File Format</strong>:</p><p>OBS consumes less space for recorded videos. It compresses the format which can drastically reduce the output file size. The best thing about OBS is that it comes with the NVENC hardware encoded chip that allows choosing from different supported file formats.</p><p>On the contrary, ShadowPlay supports MP4 formats by default which makes it require more space. It uses  codec. MP4 file format is the most popular video file format that you can play across all media players and upload on online platforms.</p><p><strong>ShadowPlay vs OBS Live Streaming</strong>:</p><p>You cannot live stream as well as record on ShadowPlay. This is a major drawback that OBS has overcome. That is why most gamers prefer OBS Studio for live streaming as they can record the gaming session for future reference. If you want to just broadcast your gameplay, ShadowPlay is good enough. But if you want to have multiple scenes and overlay adjustments in live streaming, OBS is the best choice.</p><p><strong>ShadowPlay vs OBS Editing:</strong></p><p>OBS offers better editing options thanks to its built-in editor. Starting customizable transitions to real-time editing before broadcasting, OBS has different editing scopes tailor-made for gamers. On the contrary, ShadowPlay has very limited editing options as the main focus is on recording only. But if we talk about true video editing, both applications are still underdeveloped on this front.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Alternative-Way-To-Record-Games"><a href="#Part-3-Alternative-Way-To-Record-Games" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Alternative Way To Record Games"></a>Part 3. Alternative Way To Record Games</h2><p>If you are looking for a premium gameplay recording software, we recommend Wondershare Filmora.

You can edit the recorded gameplay and export in any desired file format.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>If you want to record high-end games, ShadowPlay is ideal as it does not affect game performance as well as does not reduce frame rate. For not so high-end games, OBS does the job perfectly. OBS is particularly useful when you want to live stream as well as record your gameplay.

Microsoft’s PowerPoint program for Windows comes with various customization options for creating a presentation. In addition to text, you can place images, tables, charts, videos, links, and other types of content in your PowerPoint presentation to really make it pop.</p><p>There have been complaints from PowerPoint users about not being able to have direct access to the full detail of the presentation after presenting. One of the most prominent problems is that users want to jot things down, and at the same time, they want to pay full attention to the presenter especially when the presentation is on ‘how to’. There is a tendency to miss little vital information. Also, those who miss presentations on PowerPoint have no hope of getting the presentation in detail.</p><p>Fortunately, there is a solution to the problem. Recording PowerPoint as a video is possible. It is an interesting and helpful idea that could help users go over the whole presentation and get the information as though the PowerPoint presentation is still live. The only difference will be the time at which they watched the presentation.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-record-a-powerpoint-presentation-1.jpg"                      alt="how to record a powerpoint presentation"                ></p><p>This article will:</p><ol><li>Educate you on how to record PowerPoint presentations with video and audio, in a step-by-step approach.</li><li>Show you the benefits of recording PowerPoint presentations.</li><li>Teach you the advantages and disadvantages of using PowerPoint presentations with video and audio</li><li>Recommend a third-party tool to record PowerPoint presentations.</li></ol><h2 id="Part-I-When-you-will-need-to-record-a-PowerPoint"><a href="#Part-I-When-you-will-need-to-record-a-PowerPoint" class="headerlink" title="Part I. When you will need to record a PowerPoint?"></a>Part I. When you will need to record a PowerPoint?</h2><p>There are almost 35 million PowerPoint presentations delivered daily.</p><p>PowerPoint slides are the preferred method of delivering supplementary information that enables audiences to comprehend and relate to the concepts and ideas delivered in presentations, whether in classrooms or boardrooms. Presentations can take several forms, including</p><ul><li>Training and tutorials</li><li>Business and sales presentations</li><li>Executive communications</li><li>Product demos</li><li>Educational lectures</li><li>Student assignments</li><li>And more…</li></ul><p>But after they are delivered, what happens to all of those PowerPoint slides? Depending on the content and target audience, a select few will be shared or preserved, either publicly on SlideShare or privately on SharePoint.</p><p>In most cases, PowerPoint slides on their own, without the corresponding presentation — are incomplete and don’t do the best job of communicating the concepts from the actual presentation. Those ahead of the curve should be to share and archive recordings of their full presentations.</p><h2 id="Part-II-How-to-record-a-PowerPoint-presentation-with-video-and-audio"><a href="#Part-II-How-to-record-a-PowerPoint-presentation-with-video-and-audio" class="headerlink" title="Part II. How to record a PowerPoint presentation with video and audio"></a>Part II. How to record a PowerPoint presentation with video and audio</h2><p>You can record a presentation in real-time as you present, or do it in advance to leverage the flipped model or make your presentation available on-demand.</p><p>While there are several ways to record a presentation, this is one of the easiest ways to record a high-quality presentation in PowerPoint with audio and video.</p><h5 id="Step1-Prepare-Your-PowerPoint-Slides-and-Talking-Points"><a href="#Step1-Prepare-Your-PowerPoint-Slides-and-Talking-Points" class="headerlink" title="Step1 Prepare Your PowerPoint Slides and Talking Points"></a>Step1 Prepare Your PowerPoint Slides and Talking Points</h5><p>Before recording your presentation, ensure your slides are organized correctly and error-free. The function of your PowerPoint presentation is to act as a visual aid for the information you’re presenting, not to present all your information for you. Don’t put too much info on your slides so you won’t be tempted to read directly from them.</p><p>The image below shows how your screen will look when your presentation is ready.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-record-a-powerpoint-presentation-2.jpg"                      alt="prepare your powerpoint slides and talking points"                ></p><h5 id="Step2-Select-Your-Audio-and-Video-Sources"><a href="#Step2-Select-Your-Audio-and-Video-Sources" class="headerlink" title="Step2 Select Your Audio and Video Sources"></a>Step2 Select Your Audio and Video Sources</h5><p>You can record video, audio, or just your slide show directly within the Microsoft PowerPoint program. After you’ve opened PowerPoint, select “Recording” from the top navigation bar. This will open a new navigation bar with “Record Slide Show” and “Screen Recording” options.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-record-a-powerpoint-presentation-3.jpg"                      alt="select your audio and video sources"                ></p><p>If you just want to record your slideshow without adding audio or video, you would select “Record Slide Show”. Choosing “Screen Recording” will let you capture your slideshow while at the same time recording audio from your computer and any video on your computer screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"                                     ></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> you can start recording from the beginning or you choose a current slide to start recording from.</p><h5 id="Step3-Open-Your-PowerPoint-Slides-and-Capture-the-Screen"><a href="#Step3-Open-Your-PowerPoint-Slides-and-Capture-the-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Step3 Open Your PowerPoint Slides and Capture the Screen"></a>Step3 Open Your PowerPoint Slides and Capture the Screen</h5><p>Choose “Screen Recording,” and you’ll be given the opportunity to select the area on your screen you want to capture. Adjust the red box to fit your Powerpoint presentation. Once you have the box where you want it, you’re ready to record!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-record-a-powerpoint-presentation-4.jpg"                      alt="open your powerpoint slides and capture the screen"                ></p><h5 id="Step4-Press-Record-And-Start-Presenting"><a href="#Step4-Press-Record-And-Start-Presenting" class="headerlink" title="Step4 Press Record And Start Presenting"></a>Step4 Press Record And Start Presenting</h5><p>Make sure the “Audio” button appears gray before you hit the record button. Once you hit record, you’ll begin capturing everything in the area you’ve selected, and any audio picked up by your computer’s mic.</p><p>If you prefer, you can skip recording audio during this step and add it later. Use the “Audio” option from the PowerPoint navigation if you’re trying to find out how to record PowerPoint presentations with audio you’ve already recorded.</p><h5 id="Step5-Export-the-video-to-achieve-this-follow-the-steps-below"><a href="#Step5-Export-the-video-to-achieve-this-follow-the-steps-below" class="headerlink" title="Step5 Export the video: to achieve this, follow the steps below"></a>Step5 Export the video: to achieve this, follow the steps below</h5><ol><li>Navigate to File, click Export, and choose to Create a Video</li><li>Select the resolution</li><li>Set timing parameters or use recorded timings and narration</li><li>Click on Create Video</li><li>Choose Save as Type and select between MPEG-4 or Windows Media Video</li></ol><p><strong>Pros and Cons of Using PowerPoint to Record Your Presentation</strong></p><p>Consequently, using PowerPoint to record your presentation has some advantages and disadvantages.</p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Easy to create with free resources</li><li>Works great for doing web-based tutorials</li><li>Works great for step-by-step explanations</li><li>Create homework help, how-to’s, problem&#x2F;solution videos, and visual presentations that mark up on the screen</li><li>you can both create the presentation within the program and convert it into a video on the spot</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>PowerPoint isn’t a video editing tool.

Afterward, you should click on the Recordings option, and then select the Edit Recording feature in the Actions pop-up menu.</p><h4 id="Step-2-Editing-the-video"><a href="#Step-2-Editing-the-video" class="headerlink" title="Step 2 - Editing the video"></a>Step 2 - Editing the video</h4><p>The software’s video editor will appear on the screen, and you’ll be able to see the toolbar that enables you to play the video or cut the unwanted parts of the file.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adobe-connect-edit-video.jpg"                      alt="Adobe Connect Record Meeting"                ></p><p>Click on the Play button to preview the video or use the progress marker to jump to a desired spot in the video. You can also use the progress marker to designate the place in the video where you want to make a cut, and then simply click on the Cut icon that looks like a pair of scissors. The Adobe Connect’s video editor also enables you to control the volume level by clicking on the audio icon on the right side of the editor’s toolbar.</p><p>If you make a mistake during the video editing process, you can use the Undo button to correct it. When you remove all the unwanted parts of the video, click on the Save button to conclude the video editing session.</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p><p>Adobe Connect is one of the best software products for the creation of eLearning content and video presentations currently available on the market. Its recording and video editing features are powerful enough to enable the software’s users to capture high-quality footage of web conferences and online training, but Adobe Connect lacks advanced features high-end professionals use to create their content.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/max-wales-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Max Wales</p><p>Max Wales is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Max Wales</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-professional-strategies-for-screen-capturing-facetime/"><u>[New] In 2024, Professional Strategies for Screen-Capturing FaceTime</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/mastering-the-art-of-twilight-portraits/"><u>Mastering the Art of Twilight Portraits</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-become-a-veterinarian-on-android-12-great-simulators-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Become a Veterinarian on Android  12 Great Simulators for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/getting-started-with-adobe-presenter-video-recordings-for-2024/"><u>Getting Started with Adobe Presenter Video Recordings for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/how-to-record-youtube-videos-for-2024/"><u>How to Record YouTube Videos for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/game-on-video-recording-revolution-for-2024/"><u>Game On  Video Recording Revolution for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-high-quality-free-captures-for-your-computing-systems/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  High-Quality Free Captures for Your Computing Systems</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-comprehensive-guide-to-vsco-image-enhancement/"><u>2024 Approved  Comprehensive Guide to VSCO Image Enhancement</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/ancient-aesthetics-public-domain-pieces-for-2024/"><u>Ancient Aesthetics  Public Domain Pieces for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/choosing-streaming-giants-vimeo-youtube-or-dailymotion/"><u>Choosing Streaming Giants  Vimeo, YouTube, or DailyMotion?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/-rivalry-with-mirrorless-for-video-artistry/"><u>DSLR's Rivalry with Mirrorless for Video Artistry</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-mastery-in-mixing-incorporating-emojis-into-discords-statuses/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Mastery in Mixing  Incorporating Emojis Into Discord's Statuses</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/in-2024-why-does-the-pokemon-go-battle-league-not-available-on-asus-rog-phone-8-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Why does the pokemon go battle league not available On Asus ROG Phone 8 Pro | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-image-edition-excellence-tutorial-insights/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Image Edition Excellence  Tutorial Insights</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/updated-2023s-best-web-based-recording-tech-handpicked/"><u>[Updated] 2023'S Best Web-Based Recording Tech Handpicked</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-comprehensive-study-on-razers-camera-quality/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Comprehensive Study on Razer's Camera Quality</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>
