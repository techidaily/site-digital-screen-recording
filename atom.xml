The greatest thing is that you can live broadcast on Zoom using OBS Studio and even record your Zoom sessions using OBS Studio. OBS is recognized for its enormous community and support for hundreds of third-party plugins. As OBS is an open-source tool, you can expect it to readily connect up with dozens of other software programs, including video conferencing apps such as Zoom. To get things started, the pre-requisites are the newest version of OBS Studio, Zoom, and one of the numerous plugins that offer a virtual camera. The approach outputs OBS Studio as a virtual camera and identifies it as a video source for Zoom.</p><h3 id="Steps-to-Connect-OBS-to-Zoom-3"><a href="#Steps-to-Connect-OBS-to-Zoom-3" class="headerlink" title="Steps to Connect OBS to Zoom"></a>Steps to Connect OBS to Zoom</h3><p>**<strong>Configure OBS Studio:</strong></p><p>**<strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch OBS Studio and Select and download the relevant plugin depending on your operating system.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/configure-obs-studio.jpg"                      alt="configure obs studio"                ></p><p>**<strong>Step 2:</strong> Go to the Tools menu.

The output of the virtual camera is OBS Studio. One of Zoom’s most popular features is its native video recording. Zoom users may record meetings to either their PC or to the Zoom cloud. You can also obtain separate files for gallery view and full-sized speaker view if you record to the Zoom cloud. Yet, many individuals are adopting choices, such as Open Broadcaster Software, or OBS, to record video meetings. When utilizing OBS to record and manage your Zoom meetings, you can obtain higher-resolution video and audio. While Zoom is acceptable as a live meeting platform, the things you can accomplish with OBS greatly offset the price of setting up the system. Play around with the parameters to achieve the results that work best for you.</p><h3 id="Steps-to-live-stream-on-Zoom-with-OBS-3"><a href="#Steps-to-live-stream-on-Zoom-with-OBS-3" class="headerlink" title="Steps to live-stream on Zoom with OBS"></a>Steps to live-stream on Zoom with OBS</h3><p>**<strong>Step 1:</strong> Start your Zoom meeting and OBS concurrently and have all guests joined.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Taming-High-Quality-Streams-OBS"><a href="#Taming-High-Quality-Streams-OBS" class="headerlink" title="Taming High-Quality Streams (OBS)"></a>Taming High-Quality Streams (OBS)</h2><p>When you are live streaming through OBS Studio, encoding the video takes a lot of CPU resources. If you do not have a high-end computer, you are likely to face Encoding Overloaded issue while using OBS Studio. High encoding problem is rather common in OBS Studio because video recording and streaming demand high system resources which your computer is unable to meet.</p><p>In layman’s terms, encoding overloading means your hardware is just not running as fast as required to process the video you are streaming or recording. Since you cannot change your hardware configuration overnight, here are the different ways you can fix OBS high encoding when streaming.</p><h2 id="Way-1-Downscale-Your-Output-Resolution"><a href="#Way-1-Downscale-Your-Output-Resolution" class="headerlink" title="Way 1. Downscale Your Output Resolution"></a>Way 1. Downscale Your Output Resolution</h2><p>The higher the resolution of the video recording or streaming, the greater will be the CPU usage. This is because your processor has to process more number of pixels per frame. That is why you have to lower the output resolution of your video. Even when your base resolution is high, you have to cut down the output resolution. Base resolution is the resolution of the video at source which could be the game you are playing. The output resolution is the resolution of the video you are getting after recording or you are streaming in real-time. Here are the steps to follow.</p><p>Step 1: Open OBS and go to Settings.</p><p>Step 2: Select Video tab. You will have to look for Output (Scaled) Resolution option.</p><p>Step 3: You have to reduce the resolution from the current resolution. If it is at 1920 x 1080p, you have to bring it down to 1280 x 720p.</p><p>Step 4: Click on Apply and Ok buttons. Restart your computer and start streaming or recording again.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-reduce-the-output-resolution.jpg"                      alt="obs reduce the output resolution"                ></p><h2 id="Way-2-Lower-Your-Frame-Rate"><a href="#Way-2-Lower-Your-Frame-Rate" class="headerlink" title="Way 2. Lower Your Frame Rate"></a>Way 2. Lower Your Frame Rate</h2><p>The frame rate of a video determines the number of frames captured per second. The higher the frame rate, the greater will be the pressure on GPU to render more number of frames per second. Unless you have a powerful configuration, you will come across OBS high encoding when streaming if the frame rate is high such as 60FPS. Here are the steps to lower the frame rate of your video on OBS.</p><p>Step 1: Launch OBS and go to Settings.</p><p>Step 2: Go to Video tab and look for Common FPS Values option.</p><p>Step 3: If it is set to 60, you have to bring it down to 30. Basically, you have to reduce the current value.</p><p>Step 4: Click on Apply and Ok button to save the new setting. Restart your computer and resume your OBS operation.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-click-on-apply-and-ok-button.jpg"                      alt="obs click on apply and ok button"                ></p><h2 id="Way-3-Change-Encoder-Preset"><a href="#Way-3-Change-Encoder-Preset" class="headerlink" title="Way 3. Change Encoder Preset"></a>Way 3. Change Encoder Preset</h2><p>By default, OBS uses x264 as encoder and the encoder preset is set to “veryfast”. This is generally the best and most balanced setting. However, if you are getting OBS high encoding warning, you have to change the encoder preset to reduce the CPU usage. Generally, the higher the preset, the lower is CPU usage. Therefore, you have to set the preset from “veryfast” to “ultrafast” and here are the steps.</p><p>Step 1: Launch OBS and go to Settings.</p><p>Step 2: Go to Output tab and make sure that the encoder is Software(x264).</p><p>Step 3: Turn on Enable Advanced Encoder Settings option.</p><p>Step 4: Change the Encoder Preset from Veryfast to Ultrafast.</p><p>Step 5: Click on Apply and Ok button. Restart your computer and perform your action on OBS.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-change-encoder-preset.jpg"                      alt="obs change encoder preset"                ></p><h2 id="Way-4-Try-Hardware-Encoding"><a href="#Way-4-Try-Hardware-Encoding" class="headerlink" title="Way 4. Try Hardware Encoding"></a>Way 4. Try Hardware Encoding</h2><p>You can try out different hardware encoders available such as Quicksync, AMF, or NVENC. The availability of different hardware encoders depends on your computer hardware configuration. These hardware encoders are better than the default x264 encoder as they use less CPU resources. Since the issue is primarily with encoder, you should try changing the encoder and see if the problem is fixed.</p><p>Step 1: On OBS, you will have to go to Settings.</p><p>Step 2: Select Output tab and set Output Mode to Advanced.</p><p>Step 3: Go to Streaming tab, and check all the encoders available.</p><p>Step 4: Change the encoder from default x264 to any other hardware encoder available.</p><p>Step 5: Click on Apply and Ok to save the settings. Restart your computer and perform your operation on OBS.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-restart-your-computer-and-perform-your-operation.jpg"                      alt="obs restart your computer and perform your operation"                ></p><h2 id="Way-5-Change-Some-Advanced-Settings"><a href="#Way-5-Change-Some-Advanced-Settings" class="headerlink" title="Way 5. Change Some Advanced Settings"></a>Way 5. Change Some Advanced Settings</h2><p>If you are still facing OBS high encoding problem, you need to change some advanced settings in order to fix this encoder overloaded issue. You can change the keyframe interval so that your processor gets enough time for rendering. Similarly, you can change Rate Control from Constant to Variable so that the video does not demand high bandwidth.</p><p>Step 1: Open OBS and go to Settings.</p><p>Step 2: Go to Output tab and set Output Mode as Advanced.</p><p>Step 3: From Streaming tab, change Keyframe Interval and set it to 2 from zero.</p><p>Step 4: Change Rate Control from CBR to VBR.</p><p>Step 5: Change Profile from None to Main.</p><p>Step 6: Click on Apply and Ok button to save the changes. Restart your computer and check if the problem is resolved.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-open-and-go-to-settings.jpg"                      alt="obs open and go to settings"                ></p><h2 id="Way-6-Use-OBS-Alternative"><a href="#Way-6-Use-OBS-Alternative" class="headerlink" title="Way 6. Use OBS Alternative"></a>Way 6. Use OBS Alternative</h2><p>If none of the above-mentioned ways can solve the constant encoding overloaded warning you are receiving while using OBS Studio for recording or streaming, you have to opt for an alternative. Wondershare Filmora is the best alternative to OBS for recording screen and webcam. Filmora does not affect the CPU performance as significantly as OBS Studio does.

It is <strong>cost-effective</strong>, <strong>very reliable,</strong> and offers <strong>the best image quality for its price range.</strong> Although the C920 doesn’t have a few of the add-ons the C922 has, you can be confident that you’re still getting a fantastic camera. It excels at all the basic requirements, with <strong>impressive video quality</strong> <strong>at 1080p</strong>.</p><p>While there are a lot of other webcams that can stream 1080p HD videos, most can only stream in 1080p at the cost of a lowered frame rate.

It has all the features of the C920 with a bit extra. The C922 can stream <strong>at 60 FPS in 720p</strong>; and has a <strong>noticeable upgrade in image quality in low-lighting</strong>. This can be especially useful if you are streaming without a lighting set-up. The C922 also has a <strong>background replacement feature</strong> which you might have seen being used by some of your favorite Twitch streamers.</p><p>However, the background removal feature is software powered and the higher processor load can lead to lag.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul><li>Fantastic video quality with 60 FPS at 720p and 30 FPS at 1080</li><li>Excellent low-light self-correction</li><li>Background replacement feature designed for live streaming games</li></ul><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul><li>Background replacement can lead to performance issues</li><li>Limited audio quality compared to external mics</li><li>Cost</li></ul><p><strong>You may also like:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Record Twitch Stream <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="3-The-Best-New-Webcam-for-Twitch-Livestreaming-Razer-Kiyo"><a href="#3-The-Best-New-Webcam-for-Twitch-Livestreaming-Razer-Kiyo" class="headerlink" title="3.

That’s where the brand-new <a class="link"   href="https://amzn.to/3gyCKqJ" >Razer Kiyo <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> comes in. The Kiyo has a <strong>modern aesthetic</strong>, with <strong>twelve white LED lights in a ring formation around the lens</strong>.</p><p>The lights are adjustable with 12 different brightness settings. Razer consulted Twitch streamers in developing this camera, so it’s one of the few on the market <strong>designed specifically for you</strong>.</p><p>The Kiyo is in the same price bracket as the C922, and like the C922 it gives you <strong>60 FPS at 720p and 30 FPS at 1080p</strong>. However, compared to the mics on the Logitech C920 and C922, the Kiyo has shown to underperform.</p><p>We have reviewed the Razer Kiyo webcam in details, you can check <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Razer Kiyo webcam review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul><li>Built for Twitch streamers</li><li>Forward-thinking LED lighting</li><li>Excellent image quality at 720p and 1080p</li></ul><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul><li>Native mic audio quality is not as high as comparable cams</li><li>Cost</li></ul><h4 id="4-The-Best-Cheap-Webcam-for-Twitch-Livestreaming-Microsoft-LifeCam-Cinema"><a href="#4-The-Best-Cheap-Webcam-for-Twitch-Livestreaming-Microsoft-LifeCam-Cinema" class="headerlink" title="4.

It has a <strong>maximum resolution of 720p</strong>, with <strong>HD video up to 30 FPS</strong>. It sits on a <strong>360-degree swivel mount</strong> and the <strong>TrueColor Technology</strong> automatically boosts the image quality of the broadcast.</p><p>Like the Kiyo, the LifeCam’s mic underperforms compared to some of the other webcams, sometimes allowing background noise through that other mics would cancel.

Including <strong>infrared facial recognition</strong>, <strong>5x digital zoom</strong>, <strong>90-degree field of vision,</strong> and <strong>RightLight with HDR</strong> for recording in low-light environments.</p><p>Unfortunately, the webcam’s clip is a step down from those on the C920 and the C922, and it doesn’t hold the camera tight against the display. Although, if you can put up with that then the 4K Pro takes the best shots you’ll find right now, if you have the software to support 4K.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul><li>Beautiful 4K images</li><li>Works well in low-light</li><li>Great sound quality</li><li>90-degree field of vision</li></ul><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul><li>The clip doesn’t hold tight against displays</li><li>Cost</li></ul><p>We have reviewed the Logitech 4K Pro Webcam in details, you can check the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Logitech 4K Pro webcam complete review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>The overriding sentiment seems to be if in doubt choose Logitech! The Logitech C920 remains a firm fan-favorite for Twitch streamers, but the C922 is an impressive upgrade.

Netflix is a streaming service that allows you to subscribe and view movies and TV episodes on your internet-connected devices. With over 222 million customers by the start of 2022, Netflix is likely one of the most popular video streaming services. Netflix will never be boring you with its vast selection of fascinating TV episodes and movies, including action, thrillers, and comedies. This is why Netflix has become everyone’s favorite and we can’t get enough of it. Netflix does, however, have certain limits.</p><p>When you go on a vacation and don’t have access to Wi-Fi, you can have trouble viewing your subscription program when it airs. When it comes to screen recording Netflix, there’s always the issue of whether or not it’s legal. In most cases, the term “illegal” is used to denote a criminal law infringement. Recording and viewing copyrighted works for personal use rather than commercial objectives is not deemed a copyright violation, according to the regulation. You won’t be able to view Netflix when your membership expires. Although Netflix allows you to download some movies with tiles, they may be withdrawn from the Netflix channel before you begin binge viewing.</p><h2 id="Method-1-Use-QuickTime-to-Record-Netflix"><a href="#Method-1-Use-QuickTime-to-Record-Netflix" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Use QuickTime to Record Netflix"></a>Method 1: Use QuickTime to Record Netflix</h2><p>You may use the QuickTime Player to record Netflix episodes on your Mac.

It also enables users to utilize hotkeys during capturing to make pausing, restarting, and stopping the recording process simpler. QuickTime Player is a built-in media player for Mac OS X that allows you to watch videos on your computer. With its screen recording capability, Mac users may easily use it as a YouTube video recorder.

Netflix has added a download function that enables you to save TV shows to your smartphone for offline watching. However, the capability is not available for desktop users, and what’s more, these downloads expire as well. So that’s how simple it is to record Netflix videos. Netflix movies may be recorded in a variety of file formats, including MP4, WMV, AVI, 3GP, and others.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/the-guide-to-capturing-web-radio-frequencies-flawlessly-for-2024/"><u>The Guide to Capturing Web Radio Frequencies Flawlessly for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-a-beginners-roadmap-to-professional-video-sound-recording/"><u>[New] In 2024, A Beginner's Roadmap to Professional Video Sound Recording</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/top-10-hd-recording-apps-for-your-computer-display-for-2024/"><u>Top 10 HD Recording Apps for Your Computer Display for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/decoding-mycam-cams-video-quality-and-recording-speed-for-2024/"><u>Decoding MyCam Cam’s Video Quality and Recording Speed for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-effortless-streaming-on-android-a-compreenhensive-guide-to-obs/"><u>In 2024, Effortless Streaming on Android  A Compreenhensive Guide to OBS</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-getting-acquainted-the-google-meet-pathway/"><u>2024 Approved  Getting Acquainted  The Google Meet Pathway</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-cross-platform-filmography-syncing-smartphones-and-systems/"><u>[New] Cross-Platform Filmography  Syncing Smartphones and Systems</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-effortless-video-recordings-of-google-meets-on-phones/"><u>[New] In 2024, Effortless Video Recordings of Google Meets on Phones</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-achieving-perfect-pitch-captures-in-rl-games/"><u>[New] In 2024, Achieving Perfect Pitch Captures in RL Games</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-playtime-pathways-video-games-resembling-gta-v/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Playtime Pathways  Video Games Resembling GTA V</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/new-youtube-newbies-guide-to-channels-and-cashflow-creation/"><u>[New] Youtube Newbie's Guide to Channels and Cashflow Creation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/decoding-vimeo-where-creative-videos-meet/"><u>Decoding Vimeo  Where Creative Videos Meet</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-achieve-youtube-stardom-top-strategies-for-recognition-and-growth/"><u>[New] In 2024, Achieve YouTube Stardom  Top Strategies for Recognition and Growth</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/updated-essential-offline-ios-game-list-unplugged-fun-awaits-in-2024/"><u>[Updated] Essential Offline iOS Game List - Unplugged Fun Awaits, In 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/new-the-ultimate-discord-call-blueprint-for-pcstablets/"><u>[New] The Ultimate Discord Call Blueprint for PCs/Tablets</u></a></li><li><a href="https://apple-account.techidaily.com/in-2024-a-step-by-step-guide-to-finding-your-apple-id-on-your-iphone-13-mini-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, A Step-by-Step Guide to Finding Your Apple ID On Your iPhone 13 mini</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/in-2024-quantity-of-videos-on-128gb-storage-media/"><u>In 2024, Quantity of Videos on 128GB Storage Media</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/how-to-transfer-photos-from-nokia-c02-to-samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>How to Transfer Photos From Nokia C02 to Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fake-location.techidaily.com/will-the-ipogo-get-you-banned-and-how-to-solve-it-on-xiaomi-redmi-a2-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Will the iPogo Get You Banned and How to Solve It On Xiaomi Redmi A2 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/in-2024-unveiling-the-best-smartphone-friendly-vr-headgear/"><u>In 2024, Unveiling the Best Smartphone-Friendly VR Headgear</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

However, diverging from regular practice can sometimes lead to creative and interesting results.</p><p>Well, <strong>night-mode portraits</strong> can be such an opportunity. However, it can be a little challenging for you. Night portrait shoots require the photographer to manipulate shutter speed, aperture, ISO, and more. Besides, there are certain dos and don’ts that you also need to keep in mind. Keep reading to know more about this.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/night-potraits.jpg"                      alt="night potraits"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Must-Dos-in-Night-Portraits"><a href="#Part-1-Must-Dos-in-Night-Portraits" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Must-Dos in Night Portraits"></a>Part 1: Must-Dos in Night Portraits</h2><p>Let’s start this discussion by exploring the major dos related to <strong>night portraits</strong> photoshoots. Some dos that you should consider are:</p><h3 id="1-Shooting-with-a-topic"><a href="#1-Shooting-with-a-topic" class="headerlink" title="1. Shooting with a topic"></a>1. Shooting with a topic</h3><p>One of the most difficult repercussions of <strong>night mode portraits</strong> is that everything in your sight takes on a strange appeal, which can easily make it challenging to understand the composition and picture subject. Well, to avoid such an issue, you need to make yourself familiarized with your topic or subject. So, you can arrive at the location before sunset and begin the setup procedure.</p><p>This will also allow you to take advantage of clicking pictures during special hour lighting. Besides, it will also help you to know how changing list settings can affect the scene. Another important thing to consider here is styling your subject. You need to make sure that your subjects look professional and choose the right type of clothing. So, try to understand the purpose of your <strong>night mode portraits.</strong></p><h3 id="2-Lighting-your-Subject"><a href="#2-Lighting-your-Subject" class="headerlink" title="2. Lighting your Subject"></a>2. Lighting your Subject</h3><p>While shooting <strong>night portraits,</strong> based on the location, you may not get sufficient natural light to light up the subject. This is where you need to use some types of artificial lighting. Without this, you may not be able to capture the details of your subject. Your shots will look very blurry and underexposed. Well, artificial lighting need not be a flash. The source of artificial lighting can be anything.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/pexels-matheus-bertelli-573298.jpg"                      alt="pexels matheus bertelli 573298"                ></p><p>For example, it can be a car light, a phone flashlight, a billboard light and anything that can light up the subject, offering a decent amount of illumination to your camera. Make sure that the light is accessible. Experts suggest using off-camera flashlights for <strong>night portraits</strong> as it offers better flexibility. Based on your requirements, you can adjust the direction and brightness. Using a light stand can also be very helpful here.</p><h3 id="3-Make-Good-Use-of-Night-Mode-Portrait"><a href="#3-Make-Good-Use-of-Night-Mode-Portrait" class="headerlink" title="3. Make Good Use of Night Mode Portrait"></a>3. Make Good Use of Night Mode Portrait</h3><p>Don’t forget to take advantage of your camera’s night mode portrait option to get stunning results. Sometimes, you need to depend on software instead of your camera’s hardware for better results. Post-processing can enhance the exposure, level colors, effectively tune white balance, etc., and night mode can help you with that. When you choose this option, the camera will consider different factors, like the movement of the subjects, camera, light settings and more.</p><p>The camera will then take a series of photos at multiple exposure levels and then merge them to create a single image with great details. Even though <strong>night mode portraits</strong> can help you a lot, they may not work well while taking photos of moving objects. The reason behind this is that this mode takes multiple shots, and moving subjects would be blurred out. If it is a static scene, then go for it.</p><h3 id="4-Shooting-with-a-Stabilizer"><a href="#4-Shooting-with-a-Stabilizer" class="headerlink" title="4. Shooting with a Stabilizer"></a>4. Shooting with a Stabilizer</h3><p>For better results, you can use a camera stabilizer. A camera stabilizer will offer you the ability to take beautiful and smooth shots while moving. Stabilizers come in different configurations and sizes. They can effectively lower the vibration of the camera while moving. But shooting with a monopod, gimbal, or other rigs can be a little challenging for you. However, there are some tips that you can keep in your mind for better results, for example:</p><ul><li>Always try to maintain a perfect distance from the subject.</li><li>Use wheels.</li><li>You can also use electronic panning.</li><li>Walk carefully.</li><li>Close down the aperture.</li><li>Allow your subject to move into the focus distance.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/pexels-marcelo-dias-1970482.jpg"                      alt="pexels marcelo dias 1970482"                ></p><p>Experts suggest using a sturdy camera tripod, and it will be better to get a remote release. With this, you can trigger the camera without touching the shutter button, and it will reduce the movement of the camera.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Don’t-Dos-in-Night-Portraits"><a href="#Part-2-Don’t-Dos-in-Night-Portraits" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Don’t-Dos in Night Portraits"></a>Part 2: Don’t-Dos in Night Portraits</h2><h3 id="1-Don’t-dress-in-dark"><a href="#1-Don’t-dress-in-dark" class="headerlink" title="1. Don’t dress in dark"></a>1. Don’t dress in dark</h3><p>When it comes to wearing black for night portraits, experts suggest avoiding it unless you have proper light settings and you have your make-up done by an expert who can correct the color for shadows. Sometimes, dark clothes may create an aging effect on the subject. Besides, if the lighting condition is not good, the photos will become much darker due to your dark dress. So, wear light-colored dresses. Besides, don’t use shirts that have visible text, brand names or logos.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/pexels-nikolai-ulltang-572463.jpg"                      alt="pexels nikolai ulltang 572463"                ></p><h3 id="2-Don’t-do-a-capture-shoot"><a href="#2-Don’t-do-a-capture-shoot" class="headerlink" title="2. Don’t do a capture shoot"></a>2. Don’t do a capture shoot</h3><p>Most photographers use single shooting mode or go for the capture shoot in many cases. That could be the manual mode, and sometimes it is done to adjust the shutter and aperture manually. During night shooting, some photographers use higher ISO. This means the lens will allow more light to come in. As a result, it can create a smear while capturing a moving object. But in some cases, using continuous shooting can help you to capture some of the best moments for <strong>night portraits.</strong> If you are shooting in a fast-paced scenario, then this can help you a lot. You may not use all the images you have captured, but you can find perfect portraits.</p><h3 id="3-Don’t-Overuse-Light-The-Right-Shutter-Speed-ISO-and-Aperture"><a href="#3-Don’t-Overuse-Light-The-Right-Shutter-Speed-ISO-and-Aperture" class="headerlink" title="3. Don’t Overuse Light- The Right Shutter Speed, ISO and Aperture"></a>3. Don’t Overuse Light- The Right Shutter Speed, ISO and Aperture</h3><p>Another thing you need to avoid here is the overuse of light. You need to work on the primary exposure settings, i.e., the ISO, aperture and shutter speed. You should keep in mind that these three configurations will create exposure and influence the photos’ overall brightness. One thing to consider while choosing the setting is to have a photo with a lot of detail in the mid-tones, highlights, and shadows.</p><p>When you overuse the light, it can affect the scene’s depth of field. Besides, the sharpness of the subject will also get affected by this. To control the light, you need to choose the aperture based on the depth of field. For example, for a shallow effect, you can go for a wide aperture, like f&#x2F;2.8. You can use a narrower aperture, like f&#x2F;8, for a sharper background.</p><p>Talking about the shutter speed, for stationary subjects, you can go for 1&#x2F;160s. If it is a moving subject, then 1&#x2F;500s or above can work for you. Now, coming to the ISO, the default ISO value, i.e., ISO 100, is good for taking the highest-quality photos. If you think your portraits are overexposed, then increase the shutter speed to control the light.</p><h3 id="4-Don’t-forget-about-white-balance-and-Adjust-It-Before-Shooting"><a href="#4-Don’t-forget-about-white-balance-and-Adjust-It-Before-Shooting" class="headerlink" title="4. Don’t forget about white balance and Adjust It Before Shooting"></a>4. Don’t forget about white balance and Adjust It Before Shooting</h3><p>Speaking about white balance, it is a setting to make sure the colors in the photos are natural and accurate and the photos don’t have unrealistic colors. If the subject appears white in real but blue or red in the photos, then you need to adjust the white balance. Daylight white balance will be very warm for night photos. That’s why you need to go for cooler settings, around 3200 to 4800, based on your environment and location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/pexels-simon-robben-473107.jpg"                      alt="pexels simon robben 473107"                ></p><p>For example, in city areas, a lower setting, i.e., 3400 to 3900k, can work great. On the other hand, for darker skies, white balance settings of 4000k and above will offer you the best results. Begin with the above suggestion and click some test photos while increasing 100k after every shot to find the right white balance settings.</p><p>However, you can also preset the white balance in your camera or edit the photos during post-processing to adjust the white balance. For example, you can use color correction to fix colors. Using this, you can make the photos look brighter or darker to make them appear natural and realistic. Always use a vector scope to make sure that your colors are accurate.</p><h2 id="FAQs"><a href="#FAQs" class="headerlink" title="FAQs"></a>FAQs</h2><h3 id="How-To-Capture-Good-Portraits-at-Night"><a href="#How-To-Capture-Good-Portraits-at-Night" class="headerlink" title="How To Capture Good Portraits at Night?"></a>How To Capture Good Portraits at Night?</h3><p>As per the experts, the lower the aperture, the more light your camera will receive. This can make your <strong>night mode portraits</strong> difficult. So, you need to go for a slower shutter speed and make sure that there will be subject or camera movement. All you need to do is control the light.</p><h3 id="What-Should-You-Need-to-Avoid-in-Portrait-Photography"><a href="#What-Should-You-Need-to-Avoid-in-Portrait-Photography" class="headerlink" title="What Should You Need to Avoid in Portrait Photography?"></a>What Should You Need to Avoid in Portrait Photography?</h3><p>Some common mistakes that you need to avoid while shooting portraits are poor lighting, poor composition, bad background, using the incorrect lens, not properly focusing on the eyes, overexposure and more. Just follow the above-mentioned tips to get stunning night portraits.</p><h3 id="What-Are-the-Best-Camera-Settings-for-Night-Photography"><a href="#What-Are-the-Best-Camera-Settings-for-Night-Photography" class="headerlink" title="What Are the Best Camera Settings for Night Photography?"></a>What Are the Best Camera Settings for Night Photography?</h3><p>You should use your camera in manual mode. Besides, utilizing long camera shutter speeds, around 30 seconds to 60 seconds, will be good. Sometimes, using auto-white balance, you can get great results. The experts also suggest keeping the aperture around f&#x2F;11 and going for a low ISO, between 100 to 200.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-teaching-trends-top-10-innovative-audio-visual-recording-tools/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Teaching Trends  Top 10 Innovative Audio-Visual Recording Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/dive-into-broadcasting-proficiency-with-obs-on-youtube-and-twitch/"><u>Dive Into Broadcasting Proficiency with OBS on YouTube and Twitch</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-mastering-the-art-of-twilight-portraits/"><u>[Updated] Mastering the Art of Twilight Portraits</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-choosing-between-bandicam-and-camtasia/"><u>In 2024, Choosing Between Bandicam & Camtasia</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-adjusting-settings-for-audible-obs-broadcasts/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Adjusting Settings for Audible OBS Broadcasts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/immediate-window-image-retrieval-windows/"><u>Immediate Window Image Retrieval (Windows)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-achieving-high-quality-videos-with-your-cellphone-webcam/"><u>In 2024, Achieving High-Quality Videos with Your Cellphone Webcam</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/updated-is-insta-snap-verification-worth-it-in-2024/"><u>[Updated] Is Insta-Snap Verification Worth It, In 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-content-creator.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-discover-the-best-top-10-free-and-paid-plugins-for-final-cut-pro-x-editors/"><u>Updated In 2024, Discover the Best Top 10 Free and Paid Plugins for Final Cut Pro X Editors</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-creation-software.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-top-10-video-editing-solutions-for-creators/"><u>2024 Approved The Top 10 Video Editing Solutions for Creators</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-creation-software.techidaily.com/updated-from-widescreen-to-vertical-the-easy-way-to-repurpose-your-videos-for-2024/"><u>Updated From Widescreen to Vertical The Easy Way to Repurpose Your Videos for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/in-2024-smiling-photos-and-videos-iphones/"><u>In 2024, Smiling Photos & Videos (iPhones)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/2024-approved-live-or-recorded-twitch-versus-youtube-face-off/"><u>2024 Approved  Live or Recorded  Twitch versus YouTube Face Off</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-audio-artists-almanac-your-guide-to-video-submission/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Audio Artists' Almanac  Your Guide to Video Submission</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techidaily.com/how-to-reset-oneplus-12-without-losing-data-drfone-by-drfone-reset-android-reset-android/"><u>How to Reset OnePlus 12 without Losing Data | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-downloading-samfw-frp-tool-30-for-samsung-galaxy-a05s-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Downloading SamFw FRP Tool 3.0 for Samsung Galaxy A05s</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Microsoft’s PowerPoint program for Windows comes with various customization options for creating a presentation. In addition to text, you can place images, tables, charts, videos, links, and other types of content in your PowerPoint presentation to really make it pop.</p><p>There have been complaints from PowerPoint users about not being able to have direct access to the full detail of the presentation after presenting. One of the most prominent problems is that users want to jot things down, and at the same time, they want to pay full attention to the presenter especially when the presentation is on ‘how to’. There is a tendency to miss little vital information. Also, those who miss presentations on PowerPoint have no hope of getting the presentation in detail.</p><p>Fortunately, there is a solution to the problem. Recording PowerPoint as a video is possible. It is an interesting and helpful idea that could help users go over the whole presentation and get the information as though the PowerPoint presentation is still live. The only difference will be the time at which they watched the presentation.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-record-a-powerpoint-presentation-1.jpg"                      alt="how to record a powerpoint presentation"                ></p><p>This article will:</p><ol><li>Educate you on how to record PowerPoint presentations with video and audio, in a step-by-step approach.</li><li>Show you the benefits of recording PowerPoint presentations.</li><li>Teach you the advantages and disadvantages of using PowerPoint presentations with video and audio</li><li>Recommend a third-party tool to record PowerPoint presentations.</li></ol><h2 id="Part-I-When-you-will-need-to-record-a-PowerPoint"><a href="#Part-I-When-you-will-need-to-record-a-PowerPoint" class="headerlink" title="Part I. When you will need to record a PowerPoint?"></a>Part I. When you will need to record a PowerPoint?</h2><p>There are almost 35 million PowerPoint presentations delivered daily.</p><p>PowerPoint slides are the preferred method of delivering supplementary information that enables audiences to comprehend and relate to the concepts and ideas delivered in presentations, whether in classrooms or boardrooms. Presentations can take several forms, including</p><ul><li>Training and tutorials</li><li>Business and sales presentations</li><li>Executive communications</li><li>Product demos</li><li>Educational lectures</li><li>Student assignments</li><li>And more…</li></ul><p>But after they are delivered, what happens to all of those PowerPoint slides? Depending on the content and target audience, a select few will be shared or preserved, either publicly on SlideShare or privately on SharePoint.</p><p>In most cases, PowerPoint slides on their own, without the corresponding presentation — are incomplete and don’t do the best job of communicating the concepts from the actual presentation. Those ahead of the curve should be to share and archive recordings of their full presentations.</p><h2 id="Part-II-How-to-record-a-PowerPoint-presentation-with-video-and-audio"><a href="#Part-II-How-to-record-a-PowerPoint-presentation-with-video-and-audio" class="headerlink" title="Part II. How to record a PowerPoint presentation with video and audio"></a>Part II. How to record a PowerPoint presentation with video and audio</h2><p>You can record a presentation in real-time as you present, or do it in advance to leverage the flipped model or make your presentation available on-demand.</p><p>While there are several ways to record a presentation, this is one of the easiest ways to record a high-quality presentation in PowerPoint with audio and video.</p><h5 id="Step1-Prepare-Your-PowerPoint-Slides-and-Talking-Points"><a href="#Step1-Prepare-Your-PowerPoint-Slides-and-Talking-Points" class="headerlink" title="Step1 Prepare Your PowerPoint Slides and Talking Points"></a>Step1 Prepare Your PowerPoint Slides and Talking Points</h5><p>Before recording your presentation, ensure your slides are organized correctly and error-free. The function of your PowerPoint presentation is to act as a visual aid for the information you’re presenting, not to present all your information for you. Don’t put too much info on your slides so you won’t be tempted to read directly from them.</p><p>The image below shows how your screen will look when your presentation is ready.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-record-a-powerpoint-presentation-2.jpg"                      alt="prepare your powerpoint slides and talking points"                ></p><h5 id="Step2-Select-Your-Audio-and-Video-Sources"><a href="#Step2-Select-Your-Audio-and-Video-Sources" class="headerlink" title="Step2 Select Your Audio and Video Sources"></a>Step2 Select Your Audio and Video Sources</h5><p>You can record video, audio, or just your slide show directly within the Microsoft PowerPoint program. After you’ve opened PowerPoint, select “Recording” from the top navigation bar. This will open a new navigation bar with “Record Slide Show” and “Screen Recording” options.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-record-a-powerpoint-presentation-3.jpg"                      alt="select your audio and video sources"                ></p><p>If you just want to record your slideshow without adding audio or video, you would select “Record Slide Show”. Choosing “Screen Recording” will let you capture your slideshow while at the same time recording audio from your computer and any video on your computer screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"                                     ></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> you can start recording from the beginning or you choose a current slide to start recording from.</p><h5 id="Step3-Open-Your-PowerPoint-Slides-and-Capture-the-Screen"><a href="#Step3-Open-Your-PowerPoint-Slides-and-Capture-the-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Step3 Open Your PowerPoint Slides and Capture the Screen"></a>Step3 Open Your PowerPoint Slides and Capture the Screen</h5><p>Choose “Screen Recording,” and you’ll be given the opportunity to select the area on your screen you want to capture. Adjust the red box to fit your Powerpoint presentation. Once you have the box where you want it, you’re ready to record!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-record-a-powerpoint-presentation-4.jpg"                      alt="open your powerpoint slides and capture the screen"                ></p><h5 id="Step4-Press-Record-And-Start-Presenting"><a href="#Step4-Press-Record-And-Start-Presenting" class="headerlink" title="Step4 Press Record And Start Presenting"></a>Step4 Press Record And Start Presenting</h5><p>Make sure the “Audio” button appears gray before you hit the record button. Once you hit record, you’ll begin capturing everything in the area you’ve selected, and any audio picked up by your computer’s mic.</p><p>If you prefer, you can skip recording audio during this step and add it later. Use the “Audio” option from the PowerPoint navigation if you’re trying to find out how to record PowerPoint presentations with audio you’ve already recorded.</p><h5 id="Step5-Export-the-video-to-achieve-this-follow-the-steps-below"><a href="#Step5-Export-the-video-to-achieve-this-follow-the-steps-below" class="headerlink" title="Step5 Export the video: to achieve this, follow the steps below"></a>Step5 Export the video: to achieve this, follow the steps below</h5><ol><li>Navigate to File, click Export, and choose to Create a Video</li><li>Select the resolution</li><li>Set timing parameters or use recorded timings and narration</li><li>Click on Create Video</li><li>Choose Save as Type and select between MPEG-4 or Windows Media Video</li></ol><p><strong>Pros and Cons of Using PowerPoint to Record Your Presentation</strong></p><p>Consequently, using PowerPoint to record your presentation has some advantages and disadvantages.</p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Easy to create with free resources</li><li>Works great for doing web-based tutorials</li><li>Works great for step-by-step explanations</li><li>Create homework help, how-to’s, problem&#x2F;solution videos, and visual presentations that mark up on the screen</li><li>you can both create the presentation within the program and convert it into a video on the spot</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>PowerPoint isn’t a video editing tool.
