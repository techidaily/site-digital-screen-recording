Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> Apple is no stranger to creating minimal devices, but the 21.5-inch 4K iMac takes things to a whole new level with a screen that pops and a design that looks stylish no matter the setting. As beautiful as it is on the outside, under the hood you also have a solid set of components with a 3.4GHz 7th generation quad-core Intel Core i5 CPU, 8GB RAM, and 1TB Fusion Drive. Apple has managed to pack quite a bit of power inside the slender frame. We put it to the test to see how it fares for multimedia and productivity uses.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/TCcSm-nkER9HhHM8YIPMWbaezRA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4045927-4-fa6cf253bfd44ab991c366691b68bdf5.jpg"                      alt="Apple iMac 21.5-inch 4K"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Gannon Burgett</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082520/7443" target="_top" id="2082520">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082520" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082520/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-Beautiful-with-room-for-improvements"><a href="#Design-Beautiful-with-room-for-improvements" class="headerlink" title="Design: Beautiful, with room for improvements"></a><strong>Design: Beautiful, with room for improvements</strong></h2><p> It shouldn’t come as a surprise that the Apple iMac 21.5-inch 4K is a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-desktop-pcs-4045927" >beautiful machine <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> from top to bottom. Before even turning it on, the design of the computer a striking, aluminum-clad body that’s still subtle enough that it will blend in with nearly any office or home environment.</p><p> The tapered design makes the edges appear almost non-existent while its bulkier behind manages to round things out in a proportional manner. At its thinnest point — the edges — the iMac measures in at just 0.2 inches. On its integrated stand, the iMac measures in at 17.7 inches tall, 20.8 inches wide, and 6.9 inches deep. Amazingly, all of that weighs in at just 12.5 pounds, not including the keyboard and mouse.</p><p> Overall, the 21.5-inch 4K iMac is a solid all-in-one computer that packs a lot of power into a tiny, well-designed package.</p><p> Aside from the Apple logo on the front aluminum chin of the iMac, all of the connections and ports on the iMac are on the rear of the computer. This includes, left to right: a 3.5mm headphone jack, SD card slot, four USB 3.0 ports, two Thunderbolt 3.0 ports (USB-C), a Gigabit Ethernet port, and power adapter. There’s also a Kensington lock slot to let you secure the the iMac.</p><p> We would’ve liked to see a thinner bezel around the screen, as the one present on the iMac is about half an inch — much larger than even the most basic PC monitors. It’d be a bit different if Apple were doing more with that real estate, but as it stands, it feels like wasted space</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/gM_JxuZjDbSUs7DYtXIwUIqqz0Y=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4045927-3-d30c5f8414e94cbd9b1ec8aea9b18950.jpg"                      alt="Apple iMac 21.5-inch 4K"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2137395/7443" target="_top" id="2137395">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2137395" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2137395/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Gannon Burgett</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2100534/7443" target="_top" id="2100534">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2100534" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2100534/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-One-plug-and-you’re-good-to-go"><a href="#Setup-Process-One-plug-and-you’re-good-to-go" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: One plug and you’re good to go"></a><strong>Setup Process: One plug and you’re good to go</strong></h2><p> One of Apple’s core tenets is simplicity, and the 4K iMac is no exception to this rule. Inside the box is the computer itself and a box which contains the Magic Keyboard and Magic Mouse 2. Additional components include the power connection for the computer, a Lightning cable for charging the mouse and keyboard, and a small package of documentation.</p><p> Setting up the iMac is as simple as unwrapping it from its protective cover, setting it on the desk, plugging it in with the included power cord, and pressing the power button. As it boots up, we turned on the Magic Keyboard and Magic Mouse 2. By the time the iMac was to the setup screen — a process that took approximately 60 seconds — the two were already paired with the computer and ready to be used.</p><p> Going through the setup process took us approximately five minutes, which included setting up our iCloud account and getting the various login settings in place. We opted to set this up as a new computer, but there’s also the ability to set it up from an Apple Time Capsule backup or transfer content from a PC via USB. The amount of time those options take will vary depending on the device you’re transferring the information from as well as the amount of data being transferred.</p><h2 id="Display-Bright-brilliant-and-ready-to-shine"><a href="#Display-Bright-brilliant-and-ready-to-shine" class="headerlink" title="Display: Bright, brilliant, and ready to shine"></a><strong>Display: Bright, brilliant, and ready to shine</strong></h2><p> With a resolution of 4096 x 2304 pixels, the 4K iMac has more than 9.4 million pixels and features a pixel density of 217 pixels per inch, more than enough to make individual pixels indistinguishable at normal viewing distances. Text was clear across nearly every application and browser and photos just came to life with ridiculous levels of detail.</p><p> The brightness, contrast, and clarity of the screen are stunning. The<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-clean-your-macs-display-2260823" >display <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> can show more than one billion colors and features a wide color gamut. Apple rates the brightness at 500 nits and our testing confirmed that to be the case.</p><p> With a resolution of 4096 x 2304 pixels, the 4K iMac has more than 9.4 million pixels and features a pixel density of 217 pixels per inch</p><p> As mentioned above, it would’ve been nice to see a smaller bezel, but that’s about the only department the display falls short.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/IKZ75jBAosAG3M1Py_-E0ElYAfM=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4045927-5-a705ea67b88b4cf694c53e4715a9aceb-f57b3be92a934d8ab579d90728e23fe8.jpg"                      alt="Apple iMac 21.5-inch 4K"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Gannon Burgett</p><h2 id="Performance-Impressive-performance-from-an-all-in-one"><a href="#Performance-Impressive-performance-from-an-all-in-one" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Impressive performance from an all-in-one"></a><strong>Performance: Impressive performance from an all-in-one</strong></h2><p> Our particular iMac model for this review was the 3.4GHz quad-core Intel Core i5 iMac with 8GB of RAM and a 1TB Fusion Drive.</p><p> Before diving into the benchmark specs we achieved with this computer, we’ll first explain what a Fusion Drive is. Unlike a traditional hard drive (HDD), which relies exclusively on spinning platters to write and read information, Apple’s Fusion Drive also adds a small solid state storage (SSD) partition. This is where the operating system and most critical applications are stored, as solid state memory is much faster than traditional HDDs. The result is a drive that offers some of the advantages of SSDs while still offering the more affordable price tag and capacity of HDDs.</p><p> In our tests, boot-up time ranged from 15 seconds to 25 seconds. Considering the hybrid-style Fusion Drive, this lines up with our expectations, falling right between SSD speeds and HDD speeds. The same held true with boot-up times for various applications, ranging from Safari to more resource-intensive applications such as Final Cut Pro.</p><p> Moving onto the CPU and GPU benchmarks, we tested the iMac with both Geekbench and Cinebench to see how well the 3.4GHz quad-core processor and AMD Radeon Pro 560 held up.</p><p> “Could you build a PC with better specs for far less money? Absolutely. But it won’t be running macOS and it certainly won’t be as slim and streamlined as the iMac.”</p><p> In the Geekbench tests, the iMac scored 4,866 on the single core test, 14,151 on the multi-core test, and 56,974 on the OpenCL score. This falls in line with other iMacs of the same specifications and hovers around other computers with similar specifications. In Cinebench, the iMac achieved 93.86 frames per second in the OpenGL test and a score of 584 cb in the CPU test.</p><p> All-in-all, the iMac seems to punch right at or above its specifications when compared to similar hardware. It’s not going to be pumping out 8K footage, but for basic 4K video editing and image post-processing, the graphics card is more than enough. As for productivity, there’s not much you can throw at the iMac that it can’t handle. The only thing we noticed slowing down the computer was the 8GB of RAM when we had over a dozen applications open, but that can be fixed by upgrading to the 16GB or 32GB model (although it’s not a cheap upgrade).</p><h2 id="Network-Fast-and-reliable"><a href="#Network-Fast-and-reliable" class="headerlink" title="Network: Fast and reliable"></a><strong>Network: Fast and reliable</strong></h2><p> The 21.5-inch 4K iMac features both wired and wireless connectivity for internet access. As previously mentioned, the iMac features a Gigabit Ethernet (RJ-45) port on the rear of the computer for a hardwired internet connection. For Wi-Fi, the iMac uses an 802.11ac network adapter with support for IEEE 802.11a&#x2F;b&#x2F;g&#x2F;n.</p><p> In our hardwired tests, the iMac maxed out our Gigabit fiber optic internet no problem, with steady download and upload speeds. Wireless connectivity was equally impressive, regardless of whether the iMac was in the same room as the router or a few rooms over. We didn’t notice any drops throughout our tests and both uploading and downloading content was consistent.</p><h2 id="Camera-Decent-built-in-option-for-basic-tasks"><a href="#Camera-Decent-built-in-option-for-basic-tasks" class="headerlink" title="Camera: Decent built-in option for basic tasks"></a><strong>Camera: Decent built-in option for basic tasks</strong></h2><p> The only camera on the 4K iMac is the integrated webcam, which sits dead center above the display. We would’ve liked to see a 1080p or even 4K webcam included, but the 720p resolution is good enough for basic video messaging.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/rFu0_k9BjbUxQdoEYOcNGU35LJA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4045927-2-a3d2f38b9509480ba41bbb5b33815d1a.jpg"                      alt="Apple iMac 21.5-inch 4K"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Gannon Burgett</p><h2 id="Software-Everything-you-need-and-nothing-more"><a href="#Software-Everything-you-need-and-nothing-more" class="headerlink" title="Software: Everything you need and nothing more"></a><strong>Software: Everything you need and nothing more</strong></h2><p> As with all Apple computers, the 21.5-inch 4K iMac comes with macOS Mojave pre-installed. If you’re used to macOS as a whole, you’ll feel right at home as we did. Compared to past versions of macOS, Mojave improves in a number of areas, including an integrated Dark mode that turns much of the user interface dark grey to spare your eyes. There’s also a feature called “Stacks” that intelligently combines files of the same type on your<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-desktop-pcs-4045927" >desktop <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Improved<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-screenshot-1701742" >screenshot functionality <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> also makes snapping your screen easier.</p><p> One of the stand-out benefits of macOS is that you’ll never have to worry about paid upgrades. Apple annually announces and subsequently releases a new operating system, free of charge, to install on Apple computers. In-between major releases Apple will also push out incremental updates, at least two of which we installed during our review process. These incremental installs can be done either manually within the System Preferences applications or be set to install themselves automatically when the computer is plugged in and powered on.</p><p> Unlike Windows, macOS doesn’t come with any bloatware either. There’s a number of pre-installed apps developed by Apple, including four new ones borrowed from Apple’s mobile operating system, iOS, but most of the pre-installed apps are the standard array of programs you’d expect to see on any modern computer.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151872/7443" target="_top" id="2151872">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151872" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151872/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-The-Apple-tax-is-real"><a href="#Price-The-Apple-tax-is-real" class="headerlink" title="Price: The Apple tax is real"></a><strong>Price: The Apple tax is real</strong></h2><p> The 21.5-inch 4K iMac we tested with the aforementioned specifications retails for $1,499. Compared to other Windows PCs with similar specifications, the iMac is without pricey for the specs it offers. However, this is par for the course with Apple, so much so that the term “Apple tax” has become a commonly-used phrase. What you’re paying for is the entire package, wrapped up in one of the best-looking frames out there.</p><p> Could you build a PC with better specs for far less money? Absolutely. But it won’t be running macOS and it certainly won’t be as slim and streamlined as the iMac. If you’re invested in the Apple ecosystem and don’t need to shell out for the more expensive 27-inch 5K iMac, the 21.5-inch 4K iMac is priced much more reasonably and still has plenty to offer.</p><h2 id="Competition-A-unique-option-in-a-small-market"><a href="#Competition-A-unique-option-in-a-small-market" class="headerlink" title="Competition: A unique option in a small market"></a><strong>Competition: A unique option in a small market</strong></h2><p> The 21.5-inch 4K iMac has a few competitors in its specification range, but for the sake of simplicity, we’ll focus on two: the Lenovo IdeaCentre AIO 700 and the<a class="link"   href="https://www.asus.com/displays-desktops/all-in-one-pcs/zen-aio/" >Asus Zen AiO Pro Z240IC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> All three all-in-one desktops feature 4K displays (or at least the option to order them with 4K displays). Aside from that, the specifications also line up similarly, with i7 CPU configurations, dedicated GPU options, SSD variations, and beefy memory choices.</p><p> Of course, the biggest difference between the three desktops is that the 21.5-inch 4K iMac runs macOS while the other two run Windows 10. Using Apple’s included Boot Camp program, it’s possible to run Windows 10 (and other operating systems) on the iMac, but macOS isn’t able to be run on the other devices.</p><p> Other differences include various connections options on the back of the computers and variations in size—most notably the iMac is quite a bit smaller in dimensions across the board. That said, the larger size allows easier access to internals which makes upgrading easier on the Lenovo Ideacentre AIO 700 and Asus Zen AiO Pro Z240IC.</p><p> Prices vary greatly between the three desktops depending on the configuration you’re looking for, but overall, the 21.5-inch 4K iMac seems to hold its own in this price range, despite Apple’s notoriety for being a little bit on the pricier side.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>Beautiful display in a thin, powerful machine.</strong></p><p> The 21.5-inch 4K iMac is a solid all-in-one computer that packs a lot of power into a tiny, well-designed package. It’s not going to blow anyone away on benchmarks and it’s not cheap for the internal components you’re getting, but it has a lot to offer for multimedia and productivity. That’s not to mention the sheer convenience of having everything simply work out of the box.</p><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/microsoft-surface-studio-2-review-4689102" >Microsoft Surface Studio 2 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/alienware-aurora-r7-review-4689097" >Alienware Aurora R7 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/lenovo-thinkcentre-m720-tower-review-4776238" >Lenovo ThinkCentre M720 Tower <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  iMac 21.5-inch 4K</li><li>Product Brand  Apple</li><li>UPC  190198085795</li><li>Price  $1,499.00</li><li>Weight  12.5 lbs.</li><li>Product Dimensions  17.7 x 20.8 x 6.9 in.</li><li>Platform  Windows 10 Home</li><li>CPU  3.6GHz quad-core Intel Core i5</li><li>GPU  Raden Pro 560</li><li>RAM  8GB</li><li>Storage  1TB Fusion Drive</li><li>Connections  3.5 mm headphone jack, SDXC card slot, Four USB 3 ports (compatible with USB 2), Two Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) ports, 10&#x2F;100&#x2F;1000BASE-T Gigabit</li><li>What’s in the box  21.5‑inch iMac with Retina 4K display Magic Keyboard Magic Mouse 2 Power cord Lightning to USB Cable</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-six-innovative-approaches-for-recording-and-storing-mov-files-on-windows-11/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Six Innovative Approaches for Recording and Storing MOV Files on Windows 11</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-combining-camera-and-display-in-one-go/"><u>[New] Combining Camera and Display in One Go</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-swiftly-rotate-videos-in-vlc-for-smooth-viewing/"><u>[New] In 2024, Swiftly Rotate Videos in VLC for Smooth Viewing</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-innovative-techniques-for-lecture-to-audio-conversion-in-education-for-2024/"><u>[New] Innovative Techniques for Lecture to Audio Conversion in Education for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-cutting-edge-8-screen-tech-lists/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Cutting-Edge 8 Screen Tech Lists</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-stardew-valuable-addons-best-to-worst-ranking-list-7/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Stardew Valuable Addons - Best to Worst Ranking List (#7)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/updated-master-class-extracting-and-saving-vimeo-videos-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Master Class Extracting and Saving Vimeo Videos for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/3-ways-to-track-samsung-galaxy-a15-5g-without-them-knowing-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>3 Ways to Track Samsung Galaxy A15 5G without Them Knowing | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/easy-screenshot-methods-for-mac-users-for-2024/"><u>Easy Screenshot Methods for Mac Users for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/from-reality-to-virtuality-best-practices-for-recording-gameplay-worlds-for-2024/"><u>From Reality to Virtuality Best Practices for Recording Gameplay Worlds for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techidaily.com/how-do-i-reset-my-oneplus-ace-2v-phone-without-technical-knowledge-drfone-by-drfone-reset-android-reset-android/"><u>How do I reset my OnePlus Ace 2V Phone without technical knowledge?

The MMO industry generates 10 billion dollars a year and reaches audiences much larger than that. You can find plenty of both free MMORPG games and paid MMORPG’s. World of Warcraft, for example, has players who have cumulatively spent more time on Azeroth than the human species has existed on this planet for 6 million years. The underlying idea behind all these big numbers is a simple one: anyone, anywhere, can become anything in this virtual world (and grind out some loot along the way).</p><p>Unlike the text-based multi-user dungeons from which MMOs evolved, today’s MMOs are incredibly sophisticated. These games offer the best of the genre, be it as humanoid cats or as ruthless dictators. We’ve rounded up the best online games you can play today to celebrate that awesome lineage—and help you find the one that is worth your time. To make things simpler, we’ve also categorized them to give you a good idea of what makes each game exceptional. Also, we will share a list of free MMORPG games, so you don’t need to worry about paying anything to play these games.</p><p> You can check <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Best Clicker Games to Kill time&gt;&gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="1-World-of-Warcraft"><a href="#1-World-of-Warcraft" class="headerlink" title="1. World of Warcraft"></a><strong>1. World of Warcraft</strong></h4><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> Windows, macOS</p><p>Understandably, you may think the world of Warcraft isn’t a free MMORPG. So why is it listed? You can play the first 20 levels of the game for free, and since 20 levels mean a lot of time in World of Warcraft, you should have no problem playing it all. It is for this reason that it has been included on this list.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/world-of-warcraft-poster.jpg"                      alt="world-of-warcraft-poster"                ></p><p>There are not many people who are unfamiliar with the world of Warcraft. It’s a game that’s synonymous with the MMORPG genre. It offers players an expansive, ever-expanding universe filled with content to discover. All the elements of a quality MMORPG are present in this game, such as character customization, a persistent open world, and a compelling storyline. Getting started with World of Warcraft should be your top priority if you haven’t done so already. A game like this shouldn’t be missed.</p><h4 id="2-Guild-Wars-2"><a href="#2-Guild-Wars-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Guild Wars 2"></a><strong>2. Guild Wars 2</strong></h4><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> Windows, macOS</p><p>Another free MMORPG for beginners to start with, Guild Wars 2, has an interesting storyline that changes based on your decisions. You won’t find that in other games of its kind. As with most other MMORPGs, the game includes general features like character customization, crafting, and strong PvP and PvP elements.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/guild-wars-2-poster.jpg"                      alt=" Convert WebP to JPG"                ></p><p>It takes place in the fantasy world of Tyria and lets players explore a vast persistent world alone or with friends. As part of Guild Wars 2’s story, there are also a number of instanced environments that players will encounter. Guild Wars 2’s dynamic action-based mechanic makes leveling up far more enjoyable than World of Warcraft, which is sometimes considered a grind. If you’re tired of the monotony of leveling up in other MMORPGs, this game is for you.</p><h4 id="3-Secret-Worlds-Legends"><a href="#3-Secret-Worlds-Legends" class="headerlink" title="3. Secret Worlds Legends"></a><strong>3. Secret Worlds Legends</strong></h4><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> Windows, macOS</p><p>Secret World Legends is another recent convert to the free-to-play model. The game is defined at least partly by its setting, which is the stuff of conspiracy theory crackpots’ dreams (or their worst nightmares).

The MMO industry generates 10 billion dollars a year and reaches audiences much larger than that. You can find plenty of both free MMORPG games and paid MMORPG’s. World of Warcraft, for example, has players who have cumulatively spent more time on Azeroth than the human species has existed on this planet for 6 million years. The underlying idea behind all these big numbers is a simple one: anyone, anywhere, can become anything in this virtual world (and grind out some loot along the way).</p><p>Unlike the text-based multi-user dungeons from which MMOs evolved, today’s MMOs are incredibly sophisticated. These games offer the best of the genre, be it as humanoid cats or as ruthless dictators. We’ve rounded up the best online games you can play today to celebrate that awesome lineage—and help you find the one that is worth your time. To make things simpler, we’ve also categorized them to give you a good idea of what makes each game exceptional.

You won’t find that in other games of its kind. As with most other MMORPGs, the game includes general features like character customization, crafting, and strong PvP and PvP elements.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/guild-wars-2-poster.jpg"                      alt=" Convert WebP to JPG"                ></p><p>It takes place in the fantasy world of Tyria and lets players explore a vast persistent world alone or with friends.

As well as meticulous simulations and systems, CCP pays attention to its dedicated community and responds appropriately, as it is often their subscribers who make the decisions.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/eve-online-poster.jpg"                      alt="eve-online-poster"                ></p><p>Although detractors dismiss EVE as spreadsheets in space, the criticism highlights one of its strongest points: its real and thriving economy. It is said that in-game intrigue has spilled over into the real world on occasion, as the corporations and alliances in EVE take their business very seriously. No other game can compare with EVE Online’s depth, nuance, complicated diplomacy, and expansive space battles.</p><h4 id="Final-Verdict-3"><a href="#Final-Verdict-3" class="headerlink" title="Final Verdict"></a><strong>Final Verdict</strong></h4><p>There are countless free MMORPG games that you can find online, but the above-mentioned are some of the best games we picked for you.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Cracked-The-Full-Screen-Hurdle-in-OBS"><a href="#Cracked-The-Full-Screen-Hurdle-in-OBS" class="headerlink" title="Cracked: The Full Screen Hurdle in OBS"></a>Cracked: The Full Screen Hurdle in OBS</h2><p>OBS Studio is the most popular free video recording and streaming software. However, there are certain OBS issues that are often reported on different forums. OBS Studio not recording full screen is a common complaint. There are many who have reported that OBS is capturing Windowed screen but as soon as they are switching to Full screen recording, OBS fails miserably and captures only a black screen instead. There could be various reasons behind OBS full screen not working.</p><p>First of all, OBS Studio files could have got corrupted somehow. Sometimes, OBS Studio is heavily using CPU resources in capturing full screen, and hence, due to very fast access, CPU has limited the access of usage. There are could be a compatibility issue with OBS Studio and your Windows version. Sometimes, any third-party screen recording software could intervene in OBS operation. In this article, we will illustrate all the possible ways to fix OBS does not recording full screen issue.</p><h2 id="Way-1-Modify-CPU-Setting-for-OBS"><a href="#Way-1-Modify-CPU-Setting-for-OBS" class="headerlink" title="Way 1. Modify CPU Setting for OBS"></a>Way 1. Modify CPU Setting for OBS</h2><p>By default, OBS CPU usage present is set to very fast. This means the encoder is running very fast which leads to less CPU time usage. The higher the present, the less is the CPU usage. Unless you have a high-end computer, this default setting can lead to rendering and encoding issues. OBS uses more CPU resources when you are recording full screen. CPU tends to limit its allocation for OBS when OBS starts using CPU resources at a very fast speed. This leads to OBS not full screen recording issue. You should change the setting by taking the following steps.</p><p>Step 1: Open OBS Studio and go to Controls tab.</p><p>Step 2: Click on Settings button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-click-on-settings-button.jpg"                      alt="obs click on settings button"                ></p><p>Step 3: Go to Output tab and change Output Mode from Simple to Advanced.</p><p>Step 4: Change CPU Usage Present from Veryfast to Ultrafast so that OBS uses less CPU resources for the encoding process.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-change-cpu-usage.jpg"                      alt="obs change cpu usage"                ></p><p>Step 5: Click on Apply and Ok button.</p><h2 id="Way-2-Shut-Down-The-Game-Bar-Recording"><a href="#Way-2-Shut-Down-The-Game-Bar-Recording" class="headerlink" title="Way 2. Shut Down The Game Bar Recording"></a>Way 2. Shut Down The Game Bar Recording</h2><p>There are certain gaming features available in Windows 10 that cause rendering issue for OBS studio. If game mode is on, all the GPU resources are used in the active game and hence, OBS suffers in performance. Similarly, if Game Bar recording is on, it interferes with OBS Studio full screen recording and leads to OBS studio not recording full screen game. You need to turn off Game Bar recording by taking the following steps.</p><p>Step 1: Go to Start menu and open Settings app.</p><p>Step 2: From Setting, open Gaming option.</p><p>Step 3: Go to Xbox Game Bar tab on the left side.</p><p>4: Turn it off so that it does not record your gameplay.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/windows-settings-xbox-game-bar.jpg"                      alt="windows settings xbox game bar"                ></p><h2 id="Way-3-Empower-the-Compatibility-Mode"><a href="#Way-3-Empower-the-Compatibility-Mode" class="headerlink" title="Way 3. Empower the Compatibility Mode"></a>Way 3. Empower the Compatibility Mode</h2><p>One of the common reasons why OBS does not recording full screen is due to compatibility issue with the operating system. That is why there is an option available in Windows to run any application in compatible mode with lower Windows version. You can do the same for OBS Studio and there are many users who have reported the issue of full screen recording getting solved when they changed the compatibility mode to Windows 8. Here are the steps you have to take.</p><p>Step 1: Launch OBS Studio on your computer.</p><p>Step 2: Go to Start menu and open Task Manager.</p><p>Step 3: On Task manager, find OBS Studio under Apps. Right-click on it and select Properties.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/windows-task-manager-properties.jpg"                      alt="windows task manager properties"                ></p><p>Step 4: From Properties, copy the file location. Open File Explorer and go to the copied location by pasting on Address Bar.</p><p>Step 5: Find OBS Studio Application file and right-click on it and select Properties.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/found-obs-studio-application-file.jpg"                      alt="found obs studio application file"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2037475/7443" target="_top" id="2037475">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2037475" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2037475/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Step 6: Go to Compatibility tab and turn on “Run This Program In Compatibility Mode For”.

Turn Your Gameplay to Windowed Mode</h2><p>When OBS Studio not recording full screen game, you have to move to Windowed Mode momentarily to ensure OBS Studio is actually capturing the gameplay or not.

Re-install OBS"></a>Way 5. Re-install OBS</h2><p>Sometimes, the problem is with OBS Studio itself and not an external issue. There are times when OBS Studio may have crashed and in the process, certain important files of OBS Studio may have got corrupted. If the above solutions are not working to fix OBS not recording full screen issue, you have to uninstall and reinstall OBS Studio. In the process, you will be able to install the latest version of OBS Studio where minor glitches are fixed. Here are the steps to follow.</p><p>Step 1: Go to Control Panel &gt; Programs and Features option.</p><p>Step 2: From the list of installed applications, find OBS Studio and click on Uninstall&#x2F;Change button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/re-install-obs-uninstall.jpg"                      alt="re install obs uninstall"                ></p><p>Step 3: Once OBS Studio is successfully uninstalled, open your web browser and visit “obsproject.com”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/install-and-launch.jpg"                      alt="install and launch"                ></p><p>Step 4: Download and install OBS Studio as per your operating system.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Taming-High-Bit-Rate-in-OBS"><a href="#Taming-High-Bit-Rate-in-OBS" class="headerlink" title="Taming High-Bit Rate in OBS"></a>Taming High-Bit Rate in OBS</h2><p>When you are live streaming through OBS Studio, encoding the video takes a lot of CPU resources. If you do not have a high-end computer, you are likely to face Encoding Overloaded issue while using OBS Studio. High encoding problem is rather common in OBS Studio because video recording and streaming demand high system resources which your computer is unable to meet.</p><p>In layman’s terms, encoding overloading means your hardware is just not running as fast as required to process the video you are streaming or recording. Since you cannot change your hardware configuration overnight, here are the different ways you can fix OBS high encoding when streaming.</p><h2 id="Way-1-Downscale-Your-Output-Resolution"><a href="#Way-1-Downscale-Your-Output-Resolution" class="headerlink" title="Way 1. Downscale Your Output Resolution"></a>Way 1. Downscale Your Output Resolution</h2><p>The higher the resolution of the video recording or streaming, the greater will be the CPU usage. This is because your processor has to process more number of pixels per frame. That is why you have to lower the output resolution of your video. Even when your base resolution is high, you have to cut down the output resolution. Base resolution is the resolution of the video at source which could be the game you are playing. The output resolution is the resolution of the video you are getting after recording or you are streaming in real-time. Here are the steps to follow.</p><p>Step 1: Open OBS and go to Settings.</p><p>Step 2: Select Video tab. You will have to look for Output (Scaled) Resolution option.</p><p>Step 3: You have to reduce the resolution from the current resolution. If it is at 1920 x 1080p, you have to bring it down to 1280 x 720p.</p><p>Step 4: Click on Apply and Ok buttons. Restart your computer and start streaming or recording again.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-reduce-the-output-resolution.jpg"                      alt="obs reduce the output resolution"                ></p><h2 id="Way-2-Lower-Your-Frame-Rate"><a href="#Way-2-Lower-Your-Frame-Rate" class="headerlink" title="Way 2. Lower Your Frame Rate"></a>Way 2. Lower Your Frame Rate</h2><p>The frame rate of a video determines the number of frames captured per second. The higher the frame rate, the greater will be the pressure on GPU to render more number of frames per second. Unless you have a powerful configuration, you will come across OBS high encoding when streaming if the frame rate is high such as 60FPS. Here are the steps to lower the frame rate of your video on OBS.</p><p>Step 1: Launch OBS and go to Settings.</p><p>Step 2: Go to Video tab and look for Common FPS Values option.</p><p>Step 3: If it is set to 60, you have to bring it down to 30. Basically, you have to reduce the current value.</p><p>Step 4: Click on Apply and Ok button to save the new setting.

Change Encoder Preset"></a>Way 3. Change Encoder Preset</h2><p>By default, OBS uses x264 as encoder and the encoder preset is set to “veryfast”. This is generally the best and most balanced setting. However, if you are getting OBS high encoding warning, you have to change the encoder preset to reduce the CPU usage. Generally, the higher the preset, the lower is CPU usage. Therefore, you have to set the preset from “veryfast” to “ultrafast” and here are the steps.</p><p>Step 1: Launch OBS and go to Settings.</p><p>Step 2: Go to Output tab and make sure that the encoder is Software(x264).</p><p>Step 3: Turn on Enable Advanced Encoder Settings option.</p><p>Step 4: Change the Encoder Preset from Veryfast to Ultrafast.</p><p>Step 5: Click on Apply and Ok button.

The availability of different hardware encoders depends on your computer hardware configuration. These hardware encoders are better than the default x264 encoder as they use less CPU resources. Since the issue is primarily with encoder, you should try changing the encoder and see if the problem is fixed.</p><p>Step 1: On OBS, you will have to go to Settings.</p><p>Step 2: Select Output tab and set Output Mode to Advanced.</p><p>Step 3: Go to Streaming tab, and check all the encoders available.</p><p>Step 4: Change the encoder from default x264 to any other hardware encoder available.</p><p>Step 5: Click on Apply and Ok to save the settings.

You can change the keyframe interval so that your processor gets enough time for rendering. Similarly, you can change Rate Control from Constant to Variable so that the video does not demand high bandwidth.</p><p>Step 1: Open OBS and go to Settings.</p><p>Step 2: Go to Output tab and set Output Mode as Advanced.</p><p>Step 3: From Streaming tab, change Keyframe Interval and set it to 2 from zero.</p><p>Step 4: Change Rate Control from CBR to VBR.</p><p>Step 5: Change Profile from None to Main.</p><p>Step 6: Click on Apply and Ok button to save the changes.

Unlike other screen recorders, it does not bring down the performance of the application whose screen you are recording.

Besides, the application is not effective in recording gameplay.</p><p>Video Quality: Video quality is standard but not advanced. The video quality cannot compete with premium screen recorder. You cannot record 4K videos and therefore, it is suitable for basic recording and not for professional recording. You cannot even enhance the video quality with editor because it does not come with any editor and it is strictly a screen recorder.

The Editor’s Review"></a>Part 3. The Editor’s Review</h2><p>Now, it is time to give you our final verdict and leave no gap between the lips and the cup.</p><p>Performance: The performance of the application is smooth and flawless. Unlike other screen recorders, it does not bring down the performance of the application whose screen you are recording. However, it does take up system resources, and for an old PC, the effect could be significant. But for a modern PC, there is no issue. Therefore, it scores really well as far as performance is concerned.</p><p>Functions: As a standalone screen recorder, the app is perfect from all aspects. Starting from recording full screen and custom screen to recording with and without cursor, all standard features and some advanced features are available. You can configure the settings as per requirements and you can take screenshots and record from webcam and microphone. However, there is no basic editing option available which is a drawback. Besides, the application is not effective in recording gameplay.</p><p>Video Quality: Video quality is standard but not advanced. The video quality cannot compete with premium screen recorder. You cannot record 4K videos and therefore, it is suitable for basic recording and not for professional recording. You cannot even enhance the video quality with editor because it does not come with any editor and it is strictly a screen recorder. All in all, if you want professional video quality, you have to look for alternatives.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Other-Alternative-to-Record-Screen-on-Windows-10-3"><a href="#Part-4-Other-Alternative-to-Record-Screen-on-Windows-10-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 4.

It will help you put some extra toolbar with the record button on the left corner.</p><p>Step 2: - Next, visit media and click on the capture device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/record-screen-with-VLC.jpg"                      alt="open capture device"                ></p><p>Step 3: - Now, keep the capture mode as the “DirectShow” and select the audio input and video camera device from the menu.</p><p>You can use any device for both audio and video. It depends upon the setup, and you will choose between various video and audio devices. You must select the right one according to your setup.</p><p>Step 4: - Another option you may want is to select the Advanced options button and then plug in the specific framerate for a video. You can set it up around 30fps, and then you can do a great job by keeping the size of the video file down. You may have to experiment with it a few times to get the best video quality you wish.</p><p>Step 5: - Once you have finished the selection of your video and audio device and set up the frame rate down, then click the Play button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/record-screen-with-vlc-11.png"                      alt="save vlc recording"                ></p><p>Step 6: - You will have to see yourself or anything you pointed your camera at the main windows. Then, you will have to hit the record button on the toolbar, which you can add earlier for starting the recording.</p><p>Step 7: - For stopping the recording, you will have to hit stop or record again to close the video recording completely. The users will have to find the recording in local video folders on the PC saved as the AVI files.</p><p>Step 8: It is worth noting that if you plan to record your voice, you will have to wear the headset or manage the audio device. Otherwise, the user will hear the voice’s echo through external speakers. The process is very similar for recording the desktop, but you have to choose various media devices.</p><p>In addition, you will need the recording in other formats, and you can also.

However, diverging from regular practice can sometimes lead to creative and interesting results.</p><p>Well, <strong>night-mode portraits</strong> can be such an opportunity. However, it can be a little challenging for you. Night portrait shoots require the photographer to manipulate shutter speed, aperture, ISO, and more. Besides, there are certain dos and don’ts that you also need to keep in mind. Keep reading to know more about this.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/night-potraits.jpg"                      alt="night potraits"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Must-Dos-in-Night-Portraits"><a href="#Part-1-Must-Dos-in-Night-Portraits" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Must-Dos in Night Portraits"></a>Part 1: Must-Dos in Night Portraits</h2><p>Let’s start this discussion by exploring the major dos related to <strong>night portraits</strong> photoshoots. Some dos that you should consider are:</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136627/26400" target="_top" id="2136627">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2136627" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136627/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-Shooting-with-a-topic"><a href="#1-Shooting-with-a-topic" class="headerlink" title="1. Shooting with a topic"></a>1. Shooting with a topic</h3><p>One of the most difficult repercussions of <strong>night mode portraits</strong> is that everything in your sight takes on a strange appeal, which can easily make it challenging to understand the composition and picture subject. Well, to avoid such an issue, you need to make yourself familiarized with your topic or subject. So, you can arrive at the location before sunset and begin the setup procedure.</p><p>This will also allow you to take advantage of clicking pictures during special hour lighting. Besides, it will also help you to know how changing list settings can affect the scene. Another important thing to consider here is styling your subject. You need to make sure that your subjects look professional and choose the right type of clothing. So, try to understand the purpose of your <strong>night mode portraits.</strong></p><h3 id="2-Lighting-your-Subject"><a href="#2-Lighting-your-Subject" class="headerlink" title="2. Lighting your Subject"></a>2. Lighting your Subject</h3><p>While shooting <strong>night portraits,</strong> based on the location, you may not get sufficient natural light to light up the subject. This is where you need to use some types of artificial lighting. Without this, you may not be able to capture the details of your subject. Your shots will look very blurry and underexposed. Well, artificial lighting need not be a flash. The source of artificial lighting can be anything.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/pexels-matheus-bertelli-573298.jpg"                      alt="pexels matheus bertelli 573298"                ></p><p>For example, it can be a car light, a phone flashlight, a billboard light and anything that can light up the subject, offering a decent amount of illumination to your camera. Make sure that the light is accessible. Experts suggest using off-camera flashlights for <strong>night portraits</strong> as it offers better flexibility. Based on your requirements, you can adjust the direction and brightness. Using a light stand can also be very helpful here.</p><h3 id="3-Make-Good-Use-of-Night-Mode-Portrait"><a href="#3-Make-Good-Use-of-Night-Mode-Portrait" class="headerlink" title="3. Make Good Use of Night Mode Portrait"></a>3. Make Good Use of Night Mode Portrait</h3><p>Don’t forget to take advantage of your camera’s night mode portrait option to get stunning results. Sometimes, you need to depend on software instead of your camera’s hardware for better results. Post-processing can enhance the exposure, level colors, effectively tune white balance, etc., and night mode can help you with that. When you choose this option, the camera will consider different factors, like the movement of the subjects, camera, light settings and more.</p><p>The camera will then take a series of photos at multiple exposure levels and then merge them to create a single image with great details. Even though <strong>night mode portraits</strong> can help you a lot, they may not work well while taking photos of moving objects. The reason behind this is that this mode takes multiple shots, and moving subjects would be blurred out. If it is a static scene, then go for it.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148650/16836" target="_top" id="2148650">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2148650" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148650/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="4-Shooting-with-a-Stabilizer"><a href="#4-Shooting-with-a-Stabilizer" class="headerlink" title="4. Shooting with a Stabilizer"></a>4. Shooting with a Stabilizer</h3><p>For better results, you can use a camera stabilizer. A camera stabilizer will offer you the ability to take beautiful and smooth shots while moving. Stabilizers come in different configurations and sizes. They can effectively lower the vibration of the camera while moving. But shooting with a monopod, gimbal, or other rigs can be a little challenging for you. However, there are some tips that you can keep in your mind for better results, for example:</p><ul><li>Always try to maintain a perfect distance from the subject.</li><li>Use wheels.</li><li>You can also use electronic panning.</li><li>Walk carefully.</li><li>Close down the aperture.</li><li>Allow your subject to move into the focus distance.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/pexels-marcelo-dias-1970482.jpg"                      alt="pexels marcelo dias 1970482"                ></p><p>Experts suggest using a sturdy camera tripod, and it will be better to get a remote release. With this, you can trigger the camera without touching the shutter button, and it will reduce the movement of the camera.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Don’t-Dos-in-Night-Portraits"><a href="#Part-2-Don’t-Dos-in-Night-Portraits" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Don’t-Dos in Night Portraits"></a>Part 2: Don’t-Dos in Night Portraits</h2><h3 id="1-Don’t-dress-in-dark"><a href="#1-Don’t-dress-in-dark" class="headerlink" title="1. Don’t dress in dark"></a>1. Don’t dress in dark</h3><p>When it comes to wearing black for night portraits, experts suggest avoiding it unless you have proper light settings and you have your make-up done by an expert who can correct the color for shadows. Sometimes, dark clothes may create an aging effect on the subject. Besides, if the lighting condition is not good, the photos will become much darker due to your dark dress. So, wear light-colored dresses. Besides, don’t use shirts that have visible text, brand names or logos.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/pexels-nikolai-ulltang-572463.jpg"                      alt="pexels nikolai ulltang 572463"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139109/17108" target="_top" id="2139109">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139109" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="320" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139109/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-Don’t-do-a-capture-shoot"><a href="#2-Don’t-do-a-capture-shoot" class="headerlink" title="2. Don’t do a capture shoot"></a>2. Don’t do a capture shoot</h3><p>Most photographers use single shooting mode or go for the capture shoot in many cases. That could be the manual mode, and sometimes it is done to adjust the shutter and aperture manually. During night shooting, some photographers use higher ISO. This means the lens will allow more light to come in. As a result, it can create a smear while capturing a moving object. But in some cases, using continuous shooting can help you to capture some of the best moments for <strong>night portraits.</strong> If you are shooting in a fast-paced scenario, then this can help you a lot. You may not use all the images you have captured, but you can find perfect portraits.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136613/26400" target="_top" id="2136613">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2136613" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136613/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-Don’t-Overuse-Light-The-Right-Shutter-Speed-ISO-and-Aperture"><a href="#3-Don’t-Overuse-Light-The-Right-Shutter-Speed-ISO-and-Aperture" class="headerlink" title="3. Don’t Overuse Light- The Right Shutter Speed, ISO and Aperture"></a>3. Don’t Overuse Light- The Right Shutter Speed, ISO and Aperture</h3><p>Another thing you need to avoid here is the overuse of light. You need to work on the primary exposure settings, i.e., the ISO, aperture and shutter speed. You should keep in mind that these three configurations will create exposure and influence the photos’ overall brightness. One thing to consider while choosing the setting is to have a photo with a lot of detail in the mid-tones, highlights, and shadows.</p><p>When you overuse the light, it can affect the scene’s depth of field. Besides, the sharpness of the subject will also get affected by this. To control the light, you need to choose the aperture based on the depth of field. For example, for a shallow effect, you can go for a wide aperture, like f&#x2F;2.8. You can use a narrower aperture, like f&#x2F;8, for a sharper background.</p><p>Talking about the shutter speed, for stationary subjects, you can go for 1&#x2F;160s. If it is a moving subject, then 1&#x2F;500s or above can work for you. Now, coming to the ISO, the default ISO value, i.e., ISO 100, is good for taking the highest-quality photos. If you think your portraits are overexposed, then increase the shutter speed to control the light.</p><h3 id="4-Don’t-forget-about-white-balance-and-Adjust-It-Before-Shooting"><a href="#4-Don’t-forget-about-white-balance-and-Adjust-It-Before-Shooting" class="headerlink" title="4. Don’t forget about white balance and Adjust It Before Shooting"></a>4. Don’t forget about white balance and Adjust It Before Shooting</h3><p>Speaking about white balance, it is a setting to make sure the colors in the photos are natural and accurate and the photos don’t have unrealistic colors. If the subject appears white in real but blue or red in the photos, then you need to adjust the white balance. Daylight white balance will be very warm for night photos. That’s why you need to go for cooler settings, around 3200 to 4800, based on your environment and location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/pexels-simon-robben-473107.jpg"                      alt="pexels simon robben 473107"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1997680/19272" target="_top" id="1997680">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1997680" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1997680/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>For example, in city areas, a lower setting, i.e., 3400 to 3900k, can work great. On the other hand, for darker skies, white balance settings of 4000k and above will offer you the best results. Begin with the above suggestion and click some test photos while increasing 100k after every shot to find the right white balance settings.</p><p>However, you can also preset the white balance in your camera or edit the photos during post-processing to adjust the white balance. For example, you can use color correction to fix colors. Using this, you can make the photos look brighter or darker to make them appear natural and realistic.

It packs powerful features that make screen recording fun, engaging, and convenient. But in this guidepost, we’ll dwell on the little-known <strong>OBS countdown timer</strong>.</p><p>So, what is the OBS Studio countdown timer, and why do you need to make one? This article discusses that and how to add a countdown timer overlay to your local videos using <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Let’s dig in!</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-OBS-Countdown-Timers"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-OBS-Countdown-Timers" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Is OBS Countdown Timers?"></a>Part 1: What Is OBS Countdown Timers?</h2><p>You probably don’t need a further introduction to a countdown timer if you’re often watching action movies or marking calendars. But clear doubts, a countdown timer is basically the remaining time in years, weeks, days, hours, minutes, or seconds before a start of an event. A good example is those James Bond movies where a bomb has, let’s say, 60 seconds before exploding.</p><p>With that said, you can use the <strong>OBS timer countdown</strong> in multiple ways. For example, you can use it to pump up excitement before a much anticipated live streaming session starts. Remember that OBS Studio supports live streaming to popular platforms like YouTube, Twitch, Facebook, etc.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/obs-countdown-timer-1.jpg"                      alt="obs countdown timer"                ></p><p>So, the timer will tell viewers the duration they’ll have to wait before the next live session. You can even add an action text after the timer ends. A countdown timer can also help you ensure that the viewer sticks around until the end of an event or video.</p><p>Picture this; you can be a fitness trainer on YouTube, Vimeo, Instagram, etc. In that case, you’ll need to perform each set of exercises for a specific duration, then rest for like 30 or 60 seconds.</p><p>So, add a timer to the video to guide the trainees throughout the session. This helps make the session more engaging and fun. Whichever the reasons you have to add an <strong>OBS count down timer</strong>, the objective is simple; communicate to the viewers the time left before an event starts or ends.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Add-a-Countdown-Timer-in-OBS"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Add-a-Countdown-Timer-in-OBS" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Add a Countdown Timer in OBS"></a>Part 2: How To Add a Countdown Timer in OBS</h2><p>Up to this point, you might think that adding an OBS countdown clock is such a complicated task. After all, OBS isn’t the most beginner-friendly screen recorder to use. But don’t fret because adding a countdown timer is one of the most straightforward things to do in OBS Studio. Let’s do that!</p><p>Step1 Fire up OBS Studio and select a recording scene on which you want to apply the countdown timer. Once the scene is ready, tap the Plus button on the Sources section, then select the Text Source. Now give the source a name. For instance, you can name it Timer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/obs-countdown-timer-2.jpg"                      alt="obs countdown timer add a text source"                ></p><p>Step2 Now you’ll see a pop-up window to customize how the timer will look. For example, click the Select font button to customize the font settings for the countdown timer. You can also customize things like opacity, gradient, background color, alignment, and more.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/obs-countdown-timer-3.jpg"                      alt="obs countdown timer customize timer details"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137225/26400" target="_top" id="2137225">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137225" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137225/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Step3 Next, click the Tools tab and then tap Scripts. Then, select the countdown.lua file and customize the countdown descriptions on the pop-up window. You can change the countdown duration and the final text after the countdown. Don’t also forget to select Timer as the Text Source. The OBS countdown timer will immediately start counting.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/obs-countdown-timer-4.jpg"                      alt="obs countdown timer add the timer file"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1918666/19272" target="_top" id="1918666">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1918666" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1918666/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082529/7443" target="_top" id="2082529">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082529" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082529/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Pro-Tip-How-To-Utilize-an-Overlay-To-Level-Up-Your-Countdown-Timer"><a href="#Pro-Tip-How-To-Utilize-an-Overlay-To-Level-Up-Your-Countdown-Timer" class="headerlink" title="Pro Tip: How To Utilize an Overlay To Level Up Your Countdown Timer"></a>Pro Tip: How To Utilize an Overlay To Level Up Your Countdown Timer</h2><p>You’ll definitely need precise timing to get the most out of the <strong>timer countdown on OBS</strong>. Also, sometimes you can record a video on your smartphone or camera and customize it with a countdown timer. If that’s the case, consider using <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>It’s a professional-grade video editor for macOS and Windows systems that allows you to add countdown timer overlays to any video. Unlike OBS, this method will enable you to add timer overlays to specific scenes on the footage, including the intro part. Even best is that the countdown timers come in multiple styles, and you can customize the timer with appropriate background audio.</p><p><strong>Steps to create a countdown timer with <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>:</strong></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><h5 id="Step1-Start-a-new-video-project"><a href="#Step1-Start-a-new-video-project" class="headerlink" title="Step1 Start a new video project"></a>Step1 Start a new video project</h5><p>Install and run Filmora on your PC, and start a New Project.

In September 2021, PlayStation showcased a packed trailer with Daddy Kratos, foes along the Atreus. The trailer has been trending since the time it was released. Even the first look of the trailer is serving us with too much suspense. The addition of new characters, game details, and plot everything is so on point. Want to know more! Let’s jump to the further details.</p><h2 id="God-of-war-Ragnarok-Release-Date"><a href="#God-of-war-Ragnarok-Release-Date" class="headerlink" title="God of war Ragnarok: Release Date"></a><strong>God of war Ragnarok: Release Date</strong></h2><p>Desperate to know about the God of war Ragnarok Release Date! You reading this is clear proof that you are waiting for this fantastic addition to gameplay. PlayStation studios and Sony Santa announced that Release Date is now shifted from 2021 to 2022. Maybe it’s not a huge surprise for you, but the gameplay is worth waiting for</p><h2 id="God-of-war-Ragnarok-Story"><a href="#God-of-war-Ragnarok-Story" class="headerlink" title="God of war Ragnarok: Story"></a><strong>God of war Ragnarok: Story</strong></h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/god-of-war-ragnarok-poster2.jpg"                      alt="god-of-war-ragnarok-poster2"                ></p><p>Now when you are aware from the God of war Ragnarok Release Date, have a look to the storyline. After watching the trailer of God of war Ragnarok, our expectations are pretty high. The game is the ninth entry within the sequel of 2018’s jaw-dropping God of war. God of war was all about ancient Greece to Scandinavia, Kratos against the monsters, and Gods of Norse Mythology. The trailer gave us the idea to expect a more confident and older Atreus, and the next story is going to be based on his giant genes.</p><p>Now, the father and son are the new face of Ragnarok, the Norse version of disaster. Their new journey will be about facing the old enemies from God of War, Freya. New enemies include Thor and Kratos with his son’s rebellious nature. His son is the only one with knowledge about Atreus. The overall story will be based on a total of Nine Realms. Before this, God of War took place in six realms. The latest realms will be Asgard, Svartalfheim, and Vanaheim, along with the previous ones.</p><p>Furthermore, the trailer clarifies that we will see some new characters like Angrboa, who will be one of the last giants in the gameplay. Have you noticed a big guy in the trailer? He is Tyr, the son of Odin and half-brother of Baldur and Thor. But, the son is imprisoned by the father, isn’t it an incredible thrill? If you focus more on the PS5 showcase, you will realize it’s a brief and cryptic teaser. The overall trailer revolves more around the arrival of Ragnarok. In the excitement of “Ragnarok is coming,” most of us are not noticing the game footage. For us, it’s a confirmation of suspense. That background warning of Kratos is not less than an alarm for Atreus and viewers that we should “get ready.” At the end of God of War, we noticed that Kratos’s wife was another mystery; she was the Giant Laufey. This clearly shows that Atreus is Half God and as well as Half-Giant. He has a different name, i.e., Loki. Yes, Loki, the trickster of the Norse Mythology.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/god-of-war-ragnarok-poster3.jpg"                      alt="god-of-war-ragnarok-poster3"                ></p><p>Now, we expect that Ragnarok will explore Faye’s past and the reason she kept it secret. Hopefully, Atreus will get the shape-changing abilities that Loki is currently notorious for. So, Atreus is not just going to be about standing on the sidelines and firing arrows at enemies.</p><h2 id="God-of-War-Ragnarok-is-not-PS5-exclusive"><a href="#God-of-War-Ragnarok-is-not-PS5-exclusive" class="headerlink" title="God of War Ragnarok is not PS5 exclusive"></a><strong>God of War Ragnarok is not PS5 exclusive</strong></h2><p>Along with the God of war Ragnarok Release Date, there is news that the game will not be a PS5 exclusive. Yes, you read it right, the game will not be a PS5 exclusive, but it’s the PlayStation exclusive. In the recent interview on PlayStation Blog, the head of the studio makes it clear that the game is soon releasing on PS4 and even on PS5. The game is going to be a big release, he added. Therefore, if you want to play God of War Ragnarok on PS4, go ahead with this.

Frame drop is a common issue if you are using OBS Studio for recording high-end games or live streaming with high output resolution. You can easily understand about OBS drop frames while streaming when your viewers complain about lagging and stuttering.</p><p>In fact, you can even check OBS stream status to find out about OBS Studio drop frames. Dropping frames literally ruins the recording and hence, it needs to be fixed before further operation. You need to understand the reasons behind OBS losing frames and take actions accordingly to fix the issue. In this article, we will explain the reasons and provide all the possible solutions to prevent OBS dropping frames recording and streaming.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-OBS-Drops-Frames"><a href="#Part-1-Why-OBS-Drops-Frames" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Why OBS Drops Frames?"></a><strong>Part 1. Why OBS Drops Frames?</strong></h2><p>OBS can drop the frame rate due to various reasons. When too many frames are dropped, the streaming server is disconnected. Dropped frames are one of the main causes which can affect streaming playback. Besides, a drop in frames leads to bad recording of screen and gameplay. Here are some of the reasons why OBS drops frames while recording or streaming.</p><ul><li>Your computer has an unstable internet connection.</li><li>Your computer has low-end hardware configuration.</li><li>Your video output resolution is very high.</li><li>Your video bitrate is very high.</li><li>Your internet upload speed is rather low.</li><li>antivirus or firewall is messing with OBS Studio.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://united.elfm.net/c/5597632/2139563/4704" target="_top" id="2139563">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/4704-2139563" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://united.elfm.net/i/5597632/2139563/4704"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Fix-OBS-Dropping-Frame"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Fix-OBS-Dropping-Frame" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.
