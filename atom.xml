Can Zoom host see private chats?"></a><strong>Q) Is Zoom chat secure, safe, and encrypted? Can Zoom host see private chats?</strong></h4><p><strong>A) Yes and No.</strong></p><p>To answer the first question, Zoom chats are encrypted. However, the encryption is disabled by default and must be enabled by turning on the <strong>Require Encryption for 3rd Party Endpoints (H323&#x2F;SIP)</strong> switch from the <strong>In Meeting (Basic)</strong> section.</p><p>Tips</p><p>As a video call host, if you don’t want the participant to save the chat content, you should enable <strong>Prevent participants from saving chat</strong> and save the changes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/zoom-meeting-chat-prevent-participants-from-saving-chat.jpg"                      alt="Zoom Meeting Chat  Saving Settings"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1902319/19272" target="_top" id="1902319">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1902319" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1902319/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Furthermore, if you have a paid subscription of Zoom, you can use advanced encryption method that is available on the <strong>IM Management</strong> page on your account’s web portal. About the second question, the host cannot see the private messages that the participants send to each other during a meeting session.</p><h4 id="Q-Can-people-see-my-chat-when-I-am-screen-sharing"><a href="#Q-Can-people-see-my-chat-when-I-am-screen-sharing" class="headerlink" title="Q) Can people see my chat when I am screen sharing?"></a><strong>Q) Can people see my chat when I am screen sharing?</strong></h4><p>A) No.</p><p>As long as you are chatting using <strong>Zoom chat</strong>, other participants cannot see your conversation. However, if there is something else on your screen such as your Facebook profile&#x2F;chat, your email account, or your bank account’s page, all those windows can be viewed by the participants you are sharing your screen with.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p><strong>Zoom chat</strong> is an easy way to converse with the participants in case there are some typical words that need to be spelled or some files to be shared. These chats are not only encrypted, they can also be controlled by the host so that the participants can send messages only to the host, to each other, or to no one at all.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-the-ultimate-guide-to-10-leading-pc-vr-headsets/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved The Ultimate Guide to 10 Leading PC VR Headsets</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-beginners-guide-to-iphone-video-capture/"><u>[New] Beginner's Guide to Iphone Video Capture</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/updated-comprehensive-guide-to-embedding-multiple-youtube-playlists-in-websites-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Comprehensive Guide to Embedding Multiple YouTube Playlists in Websites for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-essential-guide-to-saving-tv-broadcasts-online/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Essential Guide to Saving TV Broadcasts Online</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-going-beyond-why-you-might-want-an-alternate-to-vidmas-reader/"><u>2024 Approved Going Beyond Why You Might Want an Alternate to Vidma's Reader</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-infinite-possibilities-on-a-track-top-5-racing-simulators-reviewed/"><u>2024 Approved Infinite Possibilities on a Track Top 5 Racing Simulators Reviewed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-overcoming-connectivity-issues-in-remote-recording/"><u>2024 Approved Overcoming Connectivity Issues in Remote Recording</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techtrends.techidaily.com/boost-your-traffic-with-advanced-cookiebot-driven-analytics/"><u>Boost Your Traffic with Advanced Cookiebot-Driven Analytics</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-hub.techidaily.com/craftsmanship-supremacy-outpacing-algorithmic-writers/"><u>Craftsmanship Supremacy: Outpacing Algorithmic Writers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-3-ways-to-erase-apple-iphone-8-when-its-locked-within-seconds-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, 3 Ways to Erase Apple iPhone 8 When Its Locked Within Seconds</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/mastering-screen-recordings-on-windows-10-systems-for-2024/"><u>Mastering Screen Recordings on Windows 10 Systems for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-solutions.techidaily.com/optimizing-network-performance-steps-to-reduce-high-ping-in-the-thrilling-game-of-back-4-blood/"><u>Optimizing Network Performance: Steps to Reduce High Ping in the Thrilling Game of Back 4 Blood</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="The-Complete-OBS-Guide-to-Skype-Call-Recording"><a href="#The-Complete-OBS-Guide-to-Skype-Call-Recording" class="headerlink" title="The Complete OBS Guide to Skype Call Recording"></a>The Complete OBS Guide to Skype Call Recording</h2><p>Video interviews for remote jobs are quite common these days because of this quickening pace of the world around us. And these interviews are recorded to further evaluate the information exchanged, so for the recording of these videos certain tools have also been introduced in the market. I myself have used a few of them; and the most popular these days are easily zoom and skype. Both these programs offer clear communication among all concerned parties. The reason why I want to discuss skype here is that zoom’s video quality is an issue, it has got very low video quality and the audio, it records in one track so if you have made a mistake in the speaking or something audible, it will remain there.</p><p>So in this article I will discuss that how can you record your skype videos using OBS. Skype has been extensively used for quite a long time now and it hasn’t lost its edge over the years but has actually upgraded and improved its services with time. Coming to OBS which is an open-source software used widely for streaming purposes. It provides an incredible experience courtesy of its variety of editing and recording options. The audio can be recorded from the system and the microphone. And video can be fetched from the webcam. Along with the recording of specific section of the screen.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Recording-Skype-Calls-with-OBS"><a href="#Part-1-Recording-Skype-Calls-with-OBS" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Recording Skype Calls with OBS"></a>Part 1: Recording Skype Calls with OBS</h2><p>To begin with shedding some light on the OBS program:</p><p>A little piece of software that can be used for both business and non-commercial purposes. Streaming on YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook is supported. It has the ability to record the screen with cursor effects. It allows you to record your screen indefinitely. Watermarks aren’t added: the video doesn’t have any watermarks. There are options for multichannel, Multilanguage, and single channel.</p><p>Now to setup the environment for screen recording we have to follow the following steps.</p><p>Initially, you’ll be required to have skype installed on your desktop along with the up-to-date version of OBS software. After installing skype you first have to make a secondary&#x2F;backup account on skype. After that you require a secondary camera as well to record yourself because your webcam can be in demand elsewhere, so you would not be able to record yourself or even the guests wouldn’t be able to see you. And then turn on the given command in skype i-e: skype&gt;settings&gt;calling&gt;advanced&gt;’allow NDI usage’ as shown in the picture. This command allows OBS to access skype videos.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/skype-calling-settings-advanced-calling.jpg"                      alt="skype calling settings advanced calling"                ></p><p>After this you have to open the OBS program and set it up for skype calls, firs thing is to create a new scene, then you’re going to hit the plus button and select the capture device. Now you can see yourself on camera and screen can easily be cropped, while holding ‘Alt’, on OBS so fix it according to your liking. Then press ‘lock’ using the NDI plug-in.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-program-set-up-for-skype.jpg"                      alt="obs program set up for skype"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-vlc-videos-source.jpg"                      alt="obs vlc videos source"                ></p><p>To setup NDI plugin you have to visit <a class="link"   href="https://github.com/Palakis/obs-ndi/releases/tag/4.9.1" >https://github.com/Palakis/obs-ndi/releases/tag/4.9.1 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and check for the compatible version with your operating system. On this website the plugin is available for windows, mac and Linux.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obc-ndi-plugin-visit.jpg"                      alt="obc ndi plugin visit"                ></p><p>And after addition of plug in you would want to click on ‘+’ again and select NDI plugin and you can select the source video which is going to be the received video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-additon-of-plug-in.jpg"                      alt="obs additon of plug in"                ></p><p>And clicking on it will open a new window where you have to select the guest feed, which will be possible once the call has begun. The call connected will appear on the NDI plugin window.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-new-window-select-the-guest-feed.jpg"                      alt="obs new window select the guest feed"                ></p><p>As you receive the call from the reciever you will see the incoming feed of him as shown in the figure.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-receive-the-call.jpg"                      alt="obs receive the call"                ></p><p>So you can just resize it similarly as you did yours earlier and pressing the lock icon will stop you from mistakenly modify or change the video screen settings. Now to record the video you have to click on record button and your desktop starts recording.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-resize-it-similarly.jpg"                      alt="obs resize it similarly"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-OBS-Alternative-to-Record-Skype"><a href="#Part-2-OBS-Alternative-to-Record-Skype" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: OBS Alternative to Record Skype"></a>Part 2: OBS Alternative to Record Skype</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2052063/7443" target="_top" id="2052063">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2052063" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2052063/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Filmora"><a href="#Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Filmora"></a>Filmora</h3><p>Filmora is a very popular and perfect <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video recorder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and editor designed by Wondershare.

There are options for changing the audio devices for your own computer. And I recommend that you separate your audio right now. Everything is set up in a way that everything’s going to come through one audio feed. I don’t like that. I think it’s better if you separate your audio that. Let’s say you cough during an interview or something. You’re actually able to cut that out and you can actually record a separate feed itself.</p><p><strong>Capturing Audio in OBS Studio on a Mac</strong></p><p>On a Mac, you’ll need to install an additional OBS plugin to capture audio.</p><ul><li>Install iShowU Audio Capture on your computer.</li><li>Make sure you navigate to Security &amp; Privacy in your System Preferences.</li><li>To proceed, you may need to grant permission to “Shiny White Box.”</li><li>Restart your Mac after the installation is complete.</li><li>Open Audio MIDI Setup after rebooting.</li><li>At the bottom left of the window, click the Plus button.</li><li>Select Create Multi-Output Device from the drop-down menu.</li></ul><p>So form the above discussion it can be concluded that OBS for screen recording can be a very handy tool because it has the ability to easily record skype videos along with separate audio recording to avoid interference of sounds and mix ups. The separate audio recording system allows us to manipulate and modify the sounds along with the video quality. Skype is a tool much used by the world for quite some time and it still continues to serve us with numerous improvements and updates to simplify the complex world of networking today and the tools to use it properly help us communicate better with others.

There are options for changing the audio devices for your own computer. And I recommend that you separate your audio right now. Everything is set up in a way that everything’s going to come through one audio feed. I don’t like that. I think it’s better if you separate your audio that.

The introduction of a hybrid console is truly a success that offers an extraordinary graphical quality while transitioning within the home console. Although this unique adaptability needs the compromise over functionality and power compared with the handhelds and dedicated consoles that have been introduced before. The games are played on the home part that is dock and console itself, over which we put the console in the dock to get the output image over the TV screen.</p><p>Moreover, it doesn’t require the installation of the software over the hard drive. It also includes the Micro SD slot at the switch backside, which provides additional storage capacity. But the main question is <strong>how to record switch gameplay</strong>?</p><p>There are basically three ways for <strong>Nintendo switch video capture</strong> gameplay.</p><p>This article will be in two part:</p><hr><p>Part I: Capture Your Switch Video</p><ul><li><a href="#part1"><strong>1. Capture the 30s video with Nintendo Switch Record button</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part2"><strong>2. Record your whole gameplay with game built-in function</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part3"></a><a href="#part3"><strong>3. Record your whole gameplay with Capture Card</strong></a></li></ul><hr><h3 id="1-Capture-the-30s-video-with-Nintendo-Switch-Record-button"><a href="#1-Capture-the-30s-video-with-Nintendo-Switch-Record-button" class="headerlink" title="1. Capture the 30s video with Nintendo Switch Record button"></a>1. Capture the 30s video with Nintendo Switch Record button</h3><p>The controllers come up with the built-in capture button. However, this button only allows the screenshot of the video which is not ideal in any case. But it records the video for 30 seconds as well. If this time is enough to capture your gameplay then do the steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Hold the controller in your hand.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Press the capture button on the left side of controller.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/switch-console-pic.png"                      alt="switch-game-console"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Hold down this capture button marked with the square</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Wait until the message regarding capture completion is received at the screen top</p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Your last 30 seconds of gameplay will be saved in the ‘Albums.’ It will record the 30 seconds gameplay right before you press the button down, so there is no need to worry about hitting it in advance. It is a quite simple step and allows only posting the clips to social media or saving them in your phone album. It also provides video editing before posting it on social media. You will be able to see the Nintendo Switch video capture in the Albums.</p><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/switch-interface.png"                      alt="switch-interface"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1982461">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982461.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1982461">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982461.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1982461%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1982461/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-Record-your-whole-gameplay-with-game-built-in-function"><a href="#2-Record-your-whole-gameplay-with-game-built-in-function" class="headerlink" title="2. Record your whole gameplay with game built-in function"></a>2. Record your whole gameplay with game built-in function</h3><p>If you wish to save some important moves of your game in your album, then here is the second way. Some games have the option of replay saving at their bottoms, <a class="link"   href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a%5Fid/27540/~/how-to-capture-and-edit-gameplay-video" >complete list <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> including:</p><ul><li><em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em></li><li><em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em></li><li><em>ARMS</em></li><li><em>Splatoon 2</em></li></ul><p>Let’s take Smach Bros as an example. To do the recording, follow the steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> As soon as you have finished the game, the screen of the final score appears. A button appears at the top right down corner of the screen ‘Do you want to save the game’. <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/smash-bros-interface.png"                      alt="smash-bro-ending"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Click on the ‘Y’ button and then click on ‘Save.’<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/smash-bros-saving.png"                      alt="smash-bros-saving"                ></p><p>Tips: Make sure that you don’t press buttons other than ‘Y’ if you want to save the gameplay. The game replay will be lost if you do so.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> The video will be saved in the replays where you can check it. Go to the ‘Menu’ and then ‘Replays’, and the saved video will appear here (however, there is one limitation of such replays saved, that is they will be deleted as soon as the game is updated so make sure that you save the game replays in your album).</p><p>To convert the replays in the video, a straightforward option is given in the menu ‘Convert to Video.’ Go to the replay that you would like to save. Look at the right down corner and click on the ‘Convert to Video’ option.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gameplay-quality1.jpg"                      alt="video-quality-interface"                ></p><p>Tips: Within the video conversion settings, you can include information about the display, music, sound effects, and video quality of the replay. Check all these settings and select them the way you want your gameplay to be. Video quality is the most important thing to consider.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Your gameplay will be converted to the video. In the videos section of the game menu, you will find all the videos that you have saved. Now power off your Switch and remove the SD card from your Switch. Connect the SD card with PC, it will appear in the folders shown below.</p><p> <strong><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gameplay-folder1.jpg"                      alt="saving-folder"                ></strong></p><h3 id="3-Record-your-whole-gameplay-with-Capture-Card"><a href="#3-Record-your-whole-gameplay-with-Capture-Card" class="headerlink" title="3.
