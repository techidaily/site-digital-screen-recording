It has a <strong>6-element glass lens</strong> and delivers <strong>1080p at an admirable 30 FPS</strong>. It also has <strong>automatic low-light correction</strong>, which is so important to us! The result is precise and dependable streaming quality, without the need for an expensive lighting setup.</p><p>Working with OBS Studio, the Ontop+ is designed to optimise your videos for YouTube and <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Twitch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. The wide-angle view also gives you impressive <strong>80-degree panoramic views</strong>.</p><p>Now, it is often assumed that audio is something which lets even the most expensive webcams down. Ontop+ wanted to challenge this assumption and make a webcam with fantastic audio quality. With <strong>built-in dual digital noise-cancellation microphones</strong>, Ontop+ claim their camera will work in all environments. Unfortunately, they haven’t quite lived up to the hype and the audio is occasionally patchy. But, at just under $50 we are willing to overlook some of the Ontop+’s limitations to give it our seal of approval.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul><li>Price</li><li>1080p HD streaming</li><li>Wide-angle viewing lens</li><li>Optimised for YouTube and Twitch</li></ul><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul><li>Audio quality</li><li>Average Amazon rating</li></ul><h4 id="2-Logitech-BRIO"><a href="#2-Logitech-BRIO" class="headerlink" title="2.

It delivers tremendous <strong>4K Ultra HD recording</strong>, allowing streamers to produce professional-quality videos. The BRIO is capable of shooting in 3,840 x 2,160 at 30 FPS (Ultra HD), 1,920 x 1,080 at 30 or 60 FPS (Full HD) and 1,280 x 720 at 30 or 60 FPS (HD).</p><p>The BRIO is also packed with additional features such as <strong>5x digital zoom</strong>, <strong>facial recognition</strong> and <strong>omnidirectional mics</strong>. It also supports <strong>Logitech RightLight 3 with HDR</strong> which gives it exceptional performance regardless of the light conditions. Plus, you can choose between a 65-degree, 78-degree, and a 90-degree field of vision, privacy shade and a flexible mount.</p><p>For professional streamers, this is a fantastic investment piece. However, there is a catch. To stream at 4K, you’ll need to connect the Brio to a USB 3.0 port on a computer running on Intel’s seventh generation Kaby Lake processors.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul><li>4K Ultra HD recording</li><li>Logitech RightLight 3 with HDR</li><li>Fantastic audio</li></ul><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul><li>Price</li><li>Compatibility</li></ul><h4 id="3-Razer-Kiyo"><a href="#3-Razer-Kiyo" class="headerlink" title="3.

The <strong>ring-light camera</strong> is a new feature, with twelve white LED lights surrounding the lens. Plus, the Razer Kiyo lets you adjust the brightness of the ring-light camera, with <strong>12 different brightness settings,</strong> so that you can always get the most flattering light. Although the Kiyo doesn’t come with much else. There’s no facial enhancement technology or background replacement.</p><p>What it does excel at is creating a vivid stream with high resolution. It is capable of shooting <strong>1,920 x 1,080 at 30 FPS (Full HD)</strong> and <strong>1,280 x 720 at 60 FPS (HD)</strong> like a lot of its competitors. But we are convinced gamers will love the great lighting features that are unique to this style of streaming webcam. The camera was created after consultation with Twitch streamers and it also comes with built-in support for Xsplit and Open Broadcaster Software.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul><li>Built-in Ring Light</li><li>1080p HD streaming</li><li>Built for Twitch streamers</li></ul><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul><li>Audio quality</li><li>No additional features</li><li>Cost</li></ul><h4 id="4-AUKEY-FHD-Webcam"><a href="#4-AUKEY-FHD-Webcam" class="headerlink" title="4.

With <strong>1080p full HD video at 30 FPS</strong>, on a <strong>2-megapixel base</strong> and <strong>built-in stereo microphones</strong>, this webcam keeps up with its main competitors and delivers a high-resolution image.</p><p>What we love about it though is its ease of use. This camera is compatible with Windows XP, Mac OS 10.6 and Android 5.0 or higher. It has <strong>no additional software to install</strong>, just plug it into a USB port and start streaming. It is also very portable and light.</p><p>Although, the lighting might be an issue unless you have a good ambience when you stream. The Aukey also does not autofocus as well as other cameras on this list. But with a discount on Amazon, this is an excellent camera for beginners.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul><li>1080p HD streaming</li><li>Cost</li><li>Ease of use</li></ul><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul><li>No lighting correction features</li><li>No 60 FPS streaming</li></ul><h4 id="5-Razer-Stargazer"><a href="#5-Razer-Stargazer" class="headerlink" title="5. Razer Stargazer"></a>5. Razer Stargazer</h4><p>The Razer Stargazer is the best webcam at effortless background removal. It is the only external webcam with an <strong>Intel RealSense 3D camera</strong>, state of the art depth-sensing technology allows you to give more viewing space to the game and gives your viewers a more engaging experience.</p><p>However, the <a class="link"   href="https://www.tomsguide.com/us/intel-realsense-guide,news-20286.html?_ga=2.47407079.1755955212.1524468879-954383139.1524153897" >Intel RealSense camera <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> limits the camera’s compatibility to Windows 10 computers with sixth-generation or later Intel Core CPUs. This is a minimum specification that non-RealSense webcams don’t require.</p><p>Like most of its competitors the Stargazer streams <strong>1,920 x 1,080 at 30 FPS (Full HD)</strong> and <strong>1,280 x 720 at 60 FPS (HD).</strong> With the Stargazer, you will have good screen resolution, but you will not be the sharpest-looking streamer on platforms like Twitch. Occasionally, the Kiyo will struggle to focus in low-light settings, but it does have <strong>fantastic colour accuracy</strong>. What it does have over its competitors though is audio. The Stargazer wins out here because it’s <strong>fantastic at filtering out ambient noise</strong>.</p><p>If you don’t have the room or money for a physical green screen or an external mic but want effortless and professional performance the Razer Stargazer is the webcam for you, with prices starting at <strong><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Stargazer-Depth-Sensing-Webcam-1080P/dp/B01GE9QM5M" >only $150 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul><li>Incredible background removal technology</li><li>Great audio</li><li>Cost</li></ul><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul><li>Not as good video quality as some of its competitors</li><li>Not compatible with older generation computers</li></ul><p>Streamers on platforms such as Twitch, seem to be choosing Logitech cameras most often. However, although the BRIO delivers unbeatable performance for gaming, there are now other brands challenging Logitech’s gaming supremacy. Razer has two innovative cameras on this list. The Kiyo has cutting-edge lighting technology and the Stargazer, with Intel RealSense, has the best background removal technology we have seen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/logo_icon/wondershare-filmora-logo-horizontal.png"                      alt="Filmora logo"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/common/filmora-product-banner.png"                      alt="filmora product interface"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=2337838&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><iframe width="640" height="390" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rzZwphIv4RM" title="APFill - Ink and Toner Coverage Calculator" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="The-All-in-One-Screen-Recorder-Video-Editor"><a href="#The-All-in-One-Screen-Recorder-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="The All-in-One Screen Recorder &amp; Video Editor"></a>The All-in-One Screen Recorder &amp; Video Editor</h3><ul><li>Record desktop screen, voiceover, and webcam simultaneously</li><li>Edit recorded clips quickly with a wide range of professional tools</li><li>Built-in plentiful templates and effects</li><li>Export to MP4, MOV, MKV, GIF and multiple formats</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static.wondershare.com/images-filmora/images/common/securety.svg"                      alt="secure download"                >Secure Download</p><p>For those with the budget to invest in a serious piece of equipment, we would recommend the BRIO and the Stargazer, depending upon your computer’s processor.

Here’s how to get started before you learn how to blur the background in Zoom.</p><h4 id="1-–-Here-to-look-for-the-blue-background-on-Zoom"><a href="#1-–-Here-to-look-for-the-blue-background-on-Zoom" class="headerlink" title="1 – Here to look for the blue background on Zoom"></a>1 – Here to look for the blue background on Zoom</h4><p>Primarily, make sure that you are looking at your laptop’s Zoom Client. First, open Zoom; tap the <strong>Settings</strong> icon at the top right corner. From there, select “<strong>Backgrounds and Filters</strong>” in the sidebar popup. Then, follow our step-by-step guide to blur Zoom background from there.</p><h4 id="2-–-Update-Zoom-to-get-the-Blur-Background"><a href="#2-–-Update-Zoom-to-get-the-Blur-Background" class="headerlink" title="2 – Update Zoom to get the Blur Background"></a>2 – Update Zoom to get the Blur Background</h4><p>Ensure that the computer system is up to date and supports the latest version of Zoom. To check for updates, tap your profile picture of your <strong>Zoom Desktop Client</strong> at the top-right corner, then scroll down and tap where it says “<strong>Check for Updates</strong>.”</p><p>If you’ve already downloaded the latest version, restart your computer and open Zoom again to see if it shows up.</p><h4 id="3-–-Check-Your-Computer-Requirements"><a href="#3-–-Check-Your-Computer-Requirements" class="headerlink" title="3 – Check Your Computer Requirements"></a>3 – Check Your Computer Requirements</h4><p>Alternatively, you can check for Client and processor requirements. All the information related to requirements compatibility is available on the Zoom help page for virtual background requirements.</p><p>To check the compatibility, go to “<strong>Backgrounds and Filters</strong>“ and uncheck the box that says “<strong>I have a green screen</strong>“ under “<strong>Virtual Backgrounds</strong>.”</p><p>Next, hover over your list of virtual backgrounds. In case you get an error message pointing you need a green screen to support virtual backgrounds, your computer doesn’t support the blur background feature.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://natural-cycles.sjv.io/c/5597632/2072200/17885" target="_top" id="2072200"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17885-2072200"                      border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2072200/17885"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Blur-the-Background-in-Zoom-A-Step-by-Step-Guide"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Blur-the-Background-in-Zoom-A-Step-by-Step-Guide" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Blur the Background in Zoom: A Step-by-Step Guide"></a><strong>Part 2: How to Blur the Background in Zoom: A Step-by-Step Guide</strong></h2><p>Given below are the ultimate steps on how to blur the background in Zoom via different sections</p><h4 id="Steps-to-Blur-Background-on-Windows-10-before-Zoom-call"><a href="#Steps-to-Blur-Background-on-Windows-10-before-Zoom-call" class="headerlink" title="Steps to Blur Background on Windows 10 before Zoom call"></a>Steps to Blur Background on Windows 10 before Zoom call</h4><p>Steps related to background blur before your Zoom call:</p><ol><li>Install Zoom and log in to your account.</li><li>Click on the “<strong>Settings</strong>“ gear icon option at the top-right corner.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/zoom-settings-tab.jpg"                      alt="zoom settings"                ></p><ol><li>In “Settings,” select “Backgrounds and Filters.”</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/select-zoom-filters.jpg"                      alt="select zoom filters"                ></p><ol><li>Then select the “<strong>Blur</strong>” option.

It is true that these games are not very graphically intense and can’t compete for the AAA titles, but it won’t be fair to compare them with those heavy and graphics-intensive games. Played repeatedly, these games continue to keep players interested even after they are released for years. But who cares that much if you’re just looking for some good rogue game to play.</p><h2 id="What-is-a-roguelike-game-What-is-a-roguelite-game"><a href="#What-is-a-roguelike-game-What-is-a-roguelite-game" class="headerlink" title="What is a roguelike game? What is a roguelite game?"></a>What is a roguelike game? What is a roguelite game?</h2><p>Gamers have been debating whether roguelikes are different from roguelites for years. If you study them in general, you will find that both roguelikes and roguelites are the RPGs subgenres. In general, roguelikes and roguelites place more emphasis on death than other kinds of video games do.</p><p>You might have a question in your mind that what is a <strong>roguelike game</strong>? It is a convoluted category of games, but it had a clear beginning. It all started with an early dungeon crawling game, “Rogue” in 1980. At that time, computers were very limited in their speed and memory capabilities.</p><p>You have to give credit to the computer programmers because instead of taking the low memory capacity of computers as a limitation at that time, they developed a game and introduced the concept of “procedural generation to save the memory space.” If you have ever played a game that has randomly generated level systems and each time gives you a unique experience, then you have already tried a roguelike game or a roguelite game.</p><p>In roguelikes, players’ progress is usually lost if they die, while in roguelites, rewards or progression are usually saved between runs. This is the main difference between roguelikes and roguelites. Although there are many other differences, let’s focus on discussing the best roguelike games and roguelite games present today.</p><p><strong>Want a more detailed explanation?

The oppressive visuals, brutal difficulty, and extreme bleakness make the game feel so oppressive in the extreme.

You have no choice but to battle your way up the tower, which is also home to many monsters.

This game was released in 2015, featuring catchy soundtracks and groovy boss fights — a distinct title for gamers looking for a new challenge. While you’re running out of time before your next move, Crypt of the Necrodancer will have you tapping your foot and dripping with sweat as you keep ongoing.</p><p>This game deviates from roguelike conventions, forcing players to arrive at snappy judgments quickly. While quick decision-making and foresight are required in the genre, the escalating rhythm forces players to maintain a higher tempo to maintain a strong combo, and all you know is, you can’t lose the combo. If you haven’t tried this game yet, then it’s worth your time and money.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.bitdefender.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=BITLATIN&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bitdefender.com%2Fbusiness%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D30%2525%2BOff%2Ball%2BGravityZone%2BProducts"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.bitdefender.com/content/dam/bitdefender/business/campaign/1200X628.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="8-Dead-Cells"><a href="#8-Dead-Cells" class="headerlink" title="8.

You revolve around procedurally generated dungeon exploration in search of blueprints for better gear. The dungeon hosts a multitude of tough-as-nails enemies, which make finding these schematics no easy task.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/deadcells-poster.png"                      alt="deadcells-poster"                ></p><p>Various upgrades can be carried over between runs, generating a constant sense of progression. Because of this, starting a new run after a particularly messy boss fight doesn’t sting quite as much as many other roguelike games might be. There are many different weapon types and perks to unlock in Dead Cells, making it more replayable and keeps it from being monotonous.</p><h2 id="9-The-Binding-of-Isaac"><a href="#9-The-Binding-of-Isaac" class="headerlink" title="9.

This is similar to the binding of Isaac series of games and Elemental Dungeon. Some relics are also found or bought from time to time. These items give you powerful advantages in combat, which can be the difference between victory and defeat.</p><p>The main character of this game is Quan Huying, but there are several other characters you can choose from. You need to buy additional characters, though. They differ in cost, and some are $1.99 while others can be upwards of $2.99. It’s not expensive for me, but that doesn’t mean it’s necessarily ideal.</p><p>The Otherworld Legends game is incredibly entertaining to play with beautiful graphics, and enjoyable setting, and a cast of interesting characters. If you’re looking for entertaining games to pass the time, the Otherworld Legends games are an excellent choice.</p><p><strong>Bonus:</strong> you wanna record your gameplay and upload to YouTube?

Q) What is the best free video conferencing software?"></a>1. Q) What is the best free video conferencing software?</h3><p>A) That depends on your needs. For the most comprehensive plan, <strong>Cisco</strong> covers every aspect of the business through interchangeable features. For more extensive group chats, try <strong>Zoom</strong>, but do keep in mind the 40 minute limit on your call times. If your team speak different languages, then use <strong>Skype</strong> – who have a <a class="link"   href="https://www.csmonitor.com/Technology/2016/1212/Skype-s-real-time-language-translator-Can-it-really-connect-the-world" >real-time language-translation tool <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that shaves hours off your day. Lastly, <strong>UberConference</strong> is arguably the best free video conferencing software for companies who work with lots of different contractors or freelancers on a day-to-day basis. This is because you don’t need to download anything and can just jump straight in.</p><h3 id="2-Q-Is-Zoom-the-same-as-Skype"><a href="#2-Q-Is-Zoom-the-same-as-Skype" class="headerlink" title="2. Q) Is Zoom the same as Skype?"></a>2. Q) Is Zoom the same as Skype?</h3><p>A) Not quite, Skype has more of an International calling focus, while Zoom is more business meeting and conference intuitive. Zoom takes webinars and video teaching and learning as more of a priority than Skype does. Skype, on the other hand, allows free international calling by assigning local caller ID to your number.</p><h3 id="3-Q-What-is-the-best-Video-Conferencing-Software-for-Small-Businesses"><a href="#3-Q-What-is-the-best-Video-Conferencing-Software-for-Small-Businesses" class="headerlink" title="3. Q) What is the best Video Conferencing Software for Small Businesses"></a>3. Q) What is the best Video Conferencing Software for Small Businesses</h3><p>A) UberConference should match your needs. It gives you the ability to communicate with up to 50 workers, more than enough for any small business. It also means you aren’t continually inviting contractors to download software. That being said, the type you use, or that best suits your firm, depends entirely on what you need it for and how you use it.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.nero.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=42570605&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="http://cdnwww.nero.com/nero-com-wAssets/img/banners/2023/usbXcopy/Nero_USB_x_copy_Screen_2.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="To-Conclude"><a href="#To-Conclude" class="headerlink" title="To Conclude"></a>To Conclude</h2><p>There is a perfect video conferencing software app or program for everyone, but which suits your company best will depend on what your business is.

Running a session online can be a daunting task - with the right tools, information, and resources it can be smooth sailing. There are three main video conferencing apps available, Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and an app that trumps them all - Google Meet.</p><p>Google Meet is a video calling app that comes fully equipped with numerous features, such as screen presenting.

Whether it is a meeting, online class, or brainstorming session, it becomes a whole lot easier with a PowerPoint slideshow - bringing everyone on the same page!</p><p>You must be wondering <strong>how to share ppt in Google Meet</strong>, well the process is fairly simple and extremely functional. You will only need two tools to execute this screen-sharing process, a web browser, and Microsoft PowerPoint. We would advise that you use Google Chrome as your web browser as it works best with Google Meet.</p><p>Just a heads up, when you are presenting your screen on Google Meet, everyone can see what you display, so it’s best to open up your PowerPoint slides before joining the meeting so there are no surprises!</p><ol><li>Open the Microsoft PowerPoint Slides on your laptop, the model or brand of the laptop does not matter, as long as you have Microsoft PowerPoint on it</li><li>Convert your slides from the default mode to browsed by an individual mode. If you have used Microsoft PowerPoint before, then you must know that in slideshow mode the slides appear in fullscreen making it difficult to switch between applications, therefore by converting the PowerPoint it will be windowed fullscreen, allowing the presenter to switch between applications. The process is simple, just click the “Slide Show” tab, then “Set Up Slide Show”, and from the drop-down menu press “Browsed by an Individual”.</li></ol><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://modlily.sjv.io/c/5597632/2072819/17059" target="_top" id="2072819"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17059-2072819"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2072819/17059"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/powerpoint-browsed-by-individual.jpg"                      alt="set PowerPoint to individual browse"                ></p><ol><li>After setting up the PowerPoint slides, move over to Google Meet and join the meeting through the meeting link provided or schedule in a new meeting.

One easy way to do that is to leave the Google Meet session, however, that might not be so polite.</p><p>Instead, there is another way, upon finishing the discussion on the PowerPoint slides, click the stop presenting button which automatically appears on the bottom of the screen you are sharing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/stop-powerpoint-sharing-google-meet.jpg"                      alt="stop PPT sharing on Google Meet "                ></p><p>If that option is not visible to the presenter, they can return to their Google Meet session, and click the stop sharing button as shown in the image below.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4576829&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/9e740b84bb48a64dde25061566299467/products/copy_1_jp_box_big.png"                      border="0"                >Jet Profiler for MySQL, Enterprise Version： Jet Profiler for MySQL is real-time query performance and diagnostics tool for the MySQL database server.

Just because an individual starts presenting, their camera will not turn off automatically, unless it is turned off by them.</p><ol><li><strong>Can participants interact with your device while sharing a presentation?</strong></li></ol><p>No, participants cannot interact with your device while sharing a presentation. The screen is only being mirrored, therefore only the presenter has control over the device. Participants can only view it, not control the device.</p><ol><li><strong>Can you present when someone else is presenting?</strong></li></ol><p>Yes, an individual can present when someone else is presenting. If you start presenting while someone else is already presenting, their screen presenting will pause and yours will start.</p><p><strong>Are You Ready to Present PPT on Google Meet?</strong></p><p>Presenting a ppt on Google Meet is not all that difficult, if you know what to do, how to do it, and when to do it, then you are good to go. Google Meet is a video conferencing tool created to ease virtual communication and make it more functional.

Can we share multiple whiteboards in a meeting?"></a>1. Can we share multiple whiteboards in a meeting?</h4><p> Yes. Other participants of a meeting can share their whiteboard with you as well. In order to do this, you must configure Zoom by clicking the small arrow available next to the <strong>Screen Share</strong>  icon, and clicking the <strong>Multiple participants can share simultaneously</strong>  option from the menu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/zoom-meeting-share-multiple-screens.jpg"                      alt="Zoom Cloud Meeting Whiteboard on Android"                ></p><h4 id="2-Why-can’t-I-see-the-Annotation-tools"><a href="#2-Why-can’t-I-see-the-Annotation-tools" class="headerlink" title="2. Why can’t I see the Annotation tools?"></a>2. Why can’t I see the Annotation tools?</h4><p> If you have joined a meeting hosted by someone else, it is possible that the host has prohibited other participants from annotating. In this case, you can request the host to enable annotations for the other members.</p><h4 id="3-How-to-collaborate-on-a-whiteboard-in-Zoom"><a href="#3-How-to-collaborate-on-a-whiteboard-in-Zoom" class="headerlink" title="3. How to collaborate on a whiteboard in Zoom?"></a>3. How to collaborate on a whiteboard in Zoom?</h4><p> If you are a participant in a Zoom conference that has been hosted by another person, collaborating on a shared whiteboard requires you to enter the full-screen mode by clicking the <strong>Full Screen</strong>  button at the top-right corner, clicking and opening the <strong>Options</strong>  menu from the top or bottom (depending on your operating system), clicking <strong>Annotate</strong> , and then continuing with the regular annotation process.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong>  To be able to collaborate on a whiteboard, it is important that the host of the meeting has allowed the members to add annotations.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p><strong>Zoom whiteboard</strong>  allows you to share your ideas with other participants of the conference. The good thing is, while using a desktop version, you can allow participants to share their whiteboard. You can also allow or prohibit them from annotating on the whiteboard that share. About the mobile versions, Zoom is available for both Android and iOS platforms. However, the latter variant of the app can be installed only on iPad. All in all, Zoom is available for Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, and iOS devices where all the variants of the program share almost identical interface and therefore can be used seamlessly throughout.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"

The Best AZ Screen Recorder Alternatives For PC And Mac</h2><p>Like AZ Screen Video Recorder, there are many other mobile applications offering screen recording functionalities.

However, this is not the case with desktop recorders which offers more area and even allow you to set a custom section of the screen for recording.</p><p><strong>Video Editing</strong>: Unlike mobile apps, many desktop screen recording software programs also offer basic video editing capabilities, such as trimming, adding annotations, and more.</p><p><strong>More Features:</strong> In general, desktop screen recording applications have more features than their mobile counterparts.</p><p>With that being discussed, we recommend using <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> - a one-of-its-kind software that has many powerful capabilities, such as screen recording, video editing, speed ramping, royalty-free library, and more.</p><p>Here’s how you can use Filmora software to record a screen or webcam on a PC or Mac:</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p>Step1 Launch a browser, visit the official <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>website to download the software, and install it on your PC&#x2F;Mac.</p><p>Step2 Now, run the software on your PC&#x2F;Mac and click <strong>“Create New Project.”</strong> Go to the top toolbar, click <strong>“File”</strong> and head to the “Record Media” option. Select the option you want. We selected <strong>“Record PC Screen.”</strong></p><p>Step3 From the <strong>“Wondershare Screen Recorder”</strong> window, set up which part of the screen you want to record, i.e., full screen, custom, or target screen recording. Set the speaker and microphone settings and click the <strong>drop-down</strong> icon for more <strong>Settings.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/filmora-recorder-window.png"                      alt="filmora recorder window"                ></p><p>Step4 Finally, select the <strong>Start</strong> icon to begin your video.
