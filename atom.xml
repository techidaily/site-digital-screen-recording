In September 2021, PlayStation showcased a packed trailer with Daddy Kratos, foes along the Atreus. The trailer has been trending since the time it was released. Even the first look of the trailer is serving us with too much suspense. The addition of new characters, game details, and plot everything is so on point. Want to know more! Let’s jump to the further details.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://otszone.ots7.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4713324&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://green.ots7.com/screenshots/OtsAV/OtsAVTV1.90-300x188.jpg"                      border="0"                >OtsAV TV Webcaster</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="God-of-war-Ragnarok-Release-Date"><a href="#God-of-war-Ragnarok-Release-Date" class="headerlink" title="God of war Ragnarok: Release Date"></a><strong>God of war Ragnarok: Release Date</strong></h2><p>Desperate to know about the God of war Ragnarok Release Date! You reading this is clear proof that you are waiting for this fantastic addition to gameplay. PlayStation studios and Sony Santa announced that Release Date is now shifted from 2021 to 2022. Maybe it’s not a huge surprise for you, but the gameplay is worth waiting for</p><h2 id="God-of-war-Ragnarok-Story"><a href="#God-of-war-Ragnarok-Story" class="headerlink" title="God of war Ragnarok: Story"></a><strong>God of war Ragnarok: Story</strong></h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/god-of-war-ragnarok-poster2.jpg"                      alt="god-of-war-ragnarok-poster2"                ></p><p>Now when you are aware from the God of war Ragnarok Release Date, have a look to the storyline. After watching the trailer of God of war Ragnarok, our expectations are pretty high. The game is the ninth entry within the sequel of 2018’s jaw-dropping God of war. God of war was all about ancient Greece to Scandinavia, Kratos against the monsters, and Gods of Norse Mythology. The trailer gave us the idea to expect a more confident and older Atreus, and the next story is going to be based on his giant genes.</p><p>Now, the father and son are the new face of Ragnarok, the Norse version of disaster. Their new journey will be about facing the old enemies from God of War, Freya. New enemies include Thor and Kratos with his son’s rebellious nature. His son is the only one with knowledge about Atreus. The overall story will be based on a total of Nine Realms. Before this, God of War took place in six realms. The latest realms will be Asgard, Svartalfheim, and Vanaheim, along with the previous ones.</p><p>Furthermore, the trailer clarifies that we will see some new characters like Angrboa, who will be one of the last giants in the gameplay. Have you noticed a big guy in the trailer? He is Tyr, the son of Odin and half-brother of Baldur and Thor. But, the son is imprisoned by the father, isn’t it an incredible thrill? If you focus more on the PS5 showcase, you will realize it’s a brief and cryptic teaser. The overall trailer revolves more around the arrival of Ragnarok. In the excitement of “Ragnarok is coming,” most of us are not noticing the game footage. For us, it’s a confirmation of suspense. That background warning of Kratos is not less than an alarm for Atreus and viewers that we should “get ready.” At the end of God of War, we noticed that Kratos’s wife was another mystery; she was the Giant Laufey. This clearly shows that Atreus is Half God and as well as Half-Giant. He has a different name, i.e., Loki. Yes, Loki, the trickster of the Norse Mythology.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.textstudio.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=35633309&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/d6eb8222c9718486bdabce8b897380f7/products/3_premium-icon.png"                      border="0"                > Take advantage of PREMIUM features for 12 months.<br>Create your texts &#x2F; logos without any limitation.<br>No attribution required when downloading.<br>No advertising on the website.<br> TextStudio.com  PREMIUM - Yearly Membership</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/god-of-war-ragnarok-poster3.jpg"                      alt="god-of-war-ragnarok-poster3"                ></p><p>Now, we expect that Ragnarok will explore Faye’s past and the reason she kept it secret. Hopefully, Atreus will get the shape-changing abilities that Loki is currently notorious for. So, Atreus is not just going to be about standing on the sidelines and firing arrows at enemies.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mondly.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D%2BGeneral%2B970x90%2B"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/69c418c33ec2e1a4267fa9bb77fa1428/general-970x90.gif"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="God-of-War-Ragnarok-is-not-PS5-exclusive"><a href="#God-of-War-Ragnarok-is-not-PS5-exclusive" class="headerlink" title="God of War Ragnarok is not PS5 exclusive"></a><strong>God of War Ragnarok is not PS5 exclusive</strong></h2><p>Along with the God of war Ragnarok Release Date, there is news that the game will not be a PS5 exclusive.

In this article, we will explain why and how to record a voice over and how to make a voice over good to get everyone’s attention and appreciation.</p><h2 id="1-Why-To-Record-A-Voiceover"><a href="#1-Why-To-Record-A-Voiceover" class="headerlink" title="1. Why To Record A Voiceover?"></a>1. Why To Record A Voiceover?</h2><p>The engagement on a video depends both on how good the video content as well as how good the audio is. The audio in a video is not just about background music. A good voiceover can do wonders in terms of retaining the attention of the viewers as well as showcasing your personality traits.</p><p>A voice over recording is a must when you are making instructional, educational, and informational videos.

Therefore, a voiceover essentially explains the video so that everyone can understand and even relate properly.</p><h2 id="2-Essential-elements-for-a-good-voice-over"><a href="#2-Essential-elements-for-a-good-voice-over" class="headerlink" title="2. Essential elements for a good voice over"></a>2. Essential elements for a good voice over</h2><p>You have to ensure that your voice over recording is great from all perspectives. There are certain essential elements that you have to get right in order to make a voice over mediocre to good and even great.</p><p><strong>Audio Clarity</strong></p><p>Every great voiceover has perfect voice quality and comfortable volume. Audiences may find it distracting if the voiceover recording has a muddy and muffled sound. They will definitely miss the important message that you may want to share through the video. Low volume will make people difficult to hear whereas too loud can cause irritation.</p><p>To ensure audio clarity, professionals use voice over recording studio. If you generally record voice over at home, make sure you do it when there is absolute silence in the background. Besides, the mic quality should be top-notch to pick your voice only as close to original and eliminate background noise.</p><p><strong>Pacing of Pitch</strong></p><p>Pacing is the speed of how fast or slow your pitch is. If you go too fast, your audience will not be able to catch you. On the contrary, the slow pace can be boring. It is important to have a natural pace for everyone to understand as well as stay interested. Therefore, maintain a good pace throughout the video but take pauses to add audio effects. Pauses are a part of pacing for allowing the listeners to grab information and for you to breathe properly so that mic does not catch it.</p><p><strong>Vocal Tone</strong></p><p>Vocal tone is about speaking in a pleasant, soothing but natural manner. You need to make sure that the tone has to be engaging but friendly. Sometimes, you may have to fake it but it must not sound fake or boring for the listeners. A proper vocal tone comes with regular practice and experimentation.</p><p><strong>Pronunciation</strong></p><p>Always make sure that you pronounce every word correctly. The listeners must clearly understand what you speak clearly. Avoid mumbling, over-enunciating, and shouting. At times, you may have to avoid your regional accent to make the audience understand with more clarity. Always ask feedback from listeners to be better at pronouncing certain words.</p><h2 id="3-How-To-Record-A-Voice-Over"><a href="#3-How-To-Record-A-Voice-Over" class="headerlink" title="3. How To Record A Voice Over?"></a>3. How To Record A Voice Over?</h2><p>Here are the steps to follow to record voiceover properly like professionals.</p><p><strong>Getting Ready</strong></p><ul><li>Location: Look for a quiet place to work. Professional voice artists opt for a soundproof room to cancel out external noise. However, you can even go for a quiet area where there is no distracting noise. Microphones can pick up ambient noise that will be reflected in the voiceover recording. Apart from human conversations, you will also have to be careful of the sound coming from electronic gadgets such as computer fans.</li><li>Microphone: Look for a top-notch microphone as per your budget. Consider using a pop filter if you are going to use an external mic. It helps to reduce the distracting sounds with certain alphabets as well as the sound of breathing. Among affordable microphones, you may use modern earbuds or headphones with mic that you use for your smartphone. There are many USB microphones available in the market at an affordable value.</li><li>Voiceover Recorder Software: You need a good-quality audio recording software to record voiceover as well as edit the recording as per requirement. There are many free as well as premium audio recording software available in the market today. We recommend Wondershare Filmora as you can record voice over for any video like professionals as well as edit the recording of audio and video in the same software.</li></ul><p><strong>Writing A Proper Script</strong></p><p>The best way to sound professional during a voice over is to use a proper script. When you don’t use a script, then there can be a lot of pauses and you may try to think about what you will have to say next. When you use a script, you have everything planned out beforehand. Besides, you can also practice what to say when you have a script with pointers and even full explanation of each point. Try to read the script many times and be careful of the words and phrases that can be awkward. Adjust the script accordingly so that it will fit perfectly in the recording.</p><p><strong>Performing A Test Recording</strong></p><p>It is always advisable to go for a test recording to ensure that everything is working properly. In a test recording, you don’t have to go for the entire script but just a few paragraphs. Check if the audio is clear, the volume is at the right level, and the recording is seamless. Check the audio quality by using headphones and not computer speakers.</p><p>**<strong>Microphone Placement</strong> - If you keep the microphone too close to the mouth, there will be all kinds of weird sounds including air puffs. Too far placement will make your voice get fainted. The perfect placement should be about 6 to 8 inches from the mouth and it has to be slightly below the chin. Check the test recording carefully as some microphones can pick up sounds from the table and the computer.</p><p><strong>Recording Voice Over</strong></p><p>So by now, you have the video for which you want to record voiceover.

The same shortcut can be used to stop recording. All videos will be saved in the same destination folder named Video&#x2F;Capture, and the app won’t let you change this setting.</p><p>However, the DVR feature in Xbox app will allow you to choose the duration of your video or increase the quality of the video you’re recording but the mouse cursor will not be recorded.
