Moreover, you must also make sure that Zoom is compatible with the OS that is installed on your device before you can start using this video conferencing app. Here’s how you can share screens on different devices.</p><h3 id="1-Sharing-the-Screen-with-Zoom-from-the-Web-Browser"><a href="#1-Sharing-the-Screen-with-Zoom-from-the-Web-Browser" class="headerlink" title="1.

Sharing the Screen with Zoom from the Web Browser</h3><p>Zoom web client offers the option to join meetings or share screens directly from the web browser, without prior installation of the application on your computer or your Smartphone. However, the web version of Zoom <strong>has limited capabilities</strong> and it <strong>works best with Google Chrome</strong>.</p><p>To start sharing a screen you just need to click on the   <strong>Screen Share</strong>  button that is located in the meeting toolbar, select the screen you want to share and then click on the Share button in the lower right corner of the window.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/share-your-screen-zoom-web.jpg"                      alt="Share Screen on Zoom"                ></p><p>Zoom displays the preview of the screen you shared within the meeting window and it allows you to pause, resume or stop sharing the screen at any point. Clicking on the upwards arrow that is located next to the Share Screen button will enable you to choose who is going to have access to the screen you shared.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/screen-share-permission-options.jpg"                      alt="Share Screen Options on Zoom"                ></p><p>You can only opt to share a screen with all participants of a meeting or with the host while sharing a screen with the participants you select is not an option.</p><p>Want to record the screen sharing on Zoom and watch later in details, check the guide to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Record Zoom Meeting. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/c/5597632/2086436/19576" target="_top" id="2086436"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19576-2086436"                      border="0" alt="" width="1500" height="400"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2086436/19576"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-Sharing-the-Screen-from-the-iPhone-or-iPad"><a href="#2-Sharing-the-Screen-from-the-iPhone-or-iPad" class="headerlink" title="2.

So, if you can’t find the Screen Share button, you should check if the application is compatible with the operating system.</p><p>Furthermore, Windows users who see only a black screen after they share their screen should switch back to the computer’s integrated graphics. You can do this by going to the Windows Control Panel and selecting the graphic card’s control panel.</p><p>Click on the Manage 3D Settings option and then choose I would like to use the following 3D settings from the Program Settings menu. You should then go to the Select a Program to Customize the menu and add the Cphost.exe file from the Zoom Bin directory.</p><p>Proceed to click on the Add Selected Program, choose the Integrated Graphics setting and click on the Apply button. Head back to Zoom and check if the black screen issue is resolved.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Sharing one or more screens during meetings on Zoom is easy, and it won’t take much more than a few moments of your time, regardless of the device you’re using to run this application. However, you should keep in mind that mobile and web-based versions of the app offer only limited capabilities and that only Mac and PC versions of the app enable users to share multiple screens simultaneously.

The MMO industry generates 10 billion dollars a year and reaches audiences much larger than that. You can find plenty of both free MMORPG games and paid MMORPG’s. World of Warcraft, for example, has players who have cumulatively spent more time on Azeroth than the human species has existed on this planet for 6 million years. The underlying idea behind all these big numbers is a simple one: anyone, anywhere, can become anything in this virtual world (and grind out some loot along the way).</p><p>Unlike the text-based multi-user dungeons from which MMOs evolved, today’s MMOs are incredibly sophisticated. These games offer the best of the genre, be it as humanoid cats or as ruthless dictators. We’ve rounded up the best online games you can play today to celebrate that awesome lineage—and help you find the one that is worth your time. To make things simpler, we’ve also categorized them to give you a good idea of what makes each game exceptional. Also, we will share a list of free MMORPG games, so you don’t need to worry about paying anything to play these games.</p><p> You can check <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Best Clicker Games to Kill time&gt;&gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="1-World-of-Warcraft"><a href="#1-World-of-Warcraft" class="headerlink" title="1. World of Warcraft"></a><strong>1. World of Warcraft</strong></h4><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> Windows, macOS</p><p>Understandably, you may think the world of Warcraft isn’t a free MMORPG. So why is it listed? You can play the first 20 levels of the game for free, and since 20 levels mean a lot of time in World of Warcraft, you should have no problem playing it all. It is for this reason that it has been included on this list.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/world-of-warcraft-poster.jpg"                      alt="world-of-warcraft-poster"                ></p><p>There are not many people who are unfamiliar with the world of Warcraft. It’s a game that’s synonymous with the MMORPG genre. It offers players an expansive, ever-expanding universe filled with content to discover. All the elements of a quality MMORPG are present in this game, such as character customization, a persistent open world, and a compelling storyline. Getting started with World of Warcraft should be your top priority if you haven’t done so already. A game like this shouldn’t be missed.</p><h4 id="2-Guild-Wars-2"><a href="#2-Guild-Wars-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Guild Wars 2"></a><strong>2. Guild Wars 2</strong></h4><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> Windows, macOS</p><p>Another free MMORPG for beginners to start with, Guild Wars 2, has an interesting storyline that changes based on your decisions. You won’t find that in other games of its kind. As with most other MMORPGs, the game includes general features like character customization, crafting, and strong PvP and PvP elements.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/guild-wars-2-poster.jpg"                      alt=" Convert WebP to JPG"                ></p><p>It takes place in the fantasy world of Tyria and lets players explore a vast persistent world alone or with friends. As part of Guild Wars 2’s story, there are also a number of instanced environments that players will encounter. Guild Wars 2’s dynamic action-based mechanic makes leveling up far more enjoyable than World of Warcraft, which is sometimes considered a grind. If you’re tired of the monotony of leveling up in other MMORPGs, this game is for you.</p><h4 id="3-Secret-Worlds-Legends"><a href="#3-Secret-Worlds-Legends" class="headerlink" title="3. Secret Worlds Legends"></a><strong>3. Secret Worlds Legends</strong></h4><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> Windows, macOS</p><p>Secret World Legends is another recent convert to the free-to-play model. The game is defined at least partly by its setting, which is the stuff of conspiracy theory crackpots’ dreams (or their worst nightmares). A world shrouded in mystery and filled with supernatural horrors is characterized by secret societies, mythological creatures, and evil cults. This game’s events are given a dramatic sweeping sweep by some killer sound design, which effectively amps up the tension.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/secret-worlds-legends-poster.jpg"                      alt=" Convert WebP to JPG"                ></p><p>The game’s dedication to storytelling is one of its strongest features. Instead of the standard MMO trope of allowing players to queue up an out-of-control number of quests with no sense of overarching purpose, the Secret World focuses on a small number of quests at a time with clearly defined goals. The game’s narrative is emphasized by narrowing the focus, and its writing and atmosphere are showcased, which is of a fairly uniform high quality.</p><h4 id="4-Star-Conflict"><a href="#4-Star-Conflict" class="headerlink" title="4. Star Conflict"></a><strong>4. Star Conflict</strong></h4><p><strong>Platforms</strong>: Windows, Xbox One</p><p>Try Star Conflict if you like space exploration. The free MMORPG puts you in the role of a space pilot seeking out alien treasures scattered all over its expansive universe. During Star Conflict, you are tasked with collecting various spaceships, for example, fighters or massive satellites that you can float in space.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/star-conflict-poster.jpg"                      alt=" Convert WebP to JPG"                ></p><p>There are a variety of PvE quests and raids in the game, where you have to fight alien squadrons and space pirates and PvP while floating around in outer space in your spaceship. You can also customize your spaceship using various weapon types or ship modules organized under a tech tree. Another great feature of Star Conflict is that it allows players to experience the game in virtual reality with Oculus Rift.</p><h4 id="5-Skyforge"><a href="#5-Skyforge" class="headerlink" title="5. Skyforge"></a><strong>5. Skyforge</strong></h4><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> Windows</p><p>Throughout your apotheosis, you become a god, gaining followers, and ascending to godhood in a sci-fi world fully equipped with advanced technology. That’s true, all those words do not typically go together, but let’s not give up just yet. When you can make your own god in Skyforge, why be a mere minion in a vast world filled with other loot-grinders?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/skyforge-poster.jpg"                      alt=" Convert WebP to JPG"                ></p><p>Unlike many typical MMOs, Skyforge offers players the ability to change their class at any time, so matchmaking is smooth and level progression is no longer necessary. In the prestige system, characters are ranked according to their general stats rather than by leveling up. Skyforge offers a nice diversion from other MMO’s grind by changing traditional MMO systems, offering a fascinating sci-fi world, and offering action-oriented combat.</p><h4 id="6-DC-Universe-Online"><a href="#6-DC-Universe-Online" class="headerlink" title="6. DC Universe Online"></a><strong>6. DC Universe Online</strong></h4><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> Windows, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox One</p><p>DC Universe Online, an online MMORPG with custom abilities, offers the opportunity to build your own superhero and play with well-known heroes from the DC multiverse, such as Wonder Woman, Superman and Batman, among others.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/dc-universe-online-poster.jpg"                      alt=" Convert WebP to JPG"                ></p><p>In addition to its unique combat tab-targeting system which makes it stand out from other games on this list, it also makes the game more user-friendly for players. As well as having a captivating storyline, cool gear to collect, and levels that allow players to choose how they want to progress in the game, DC Universe Online offers many other features that will appeal to gamers.</p><h4 id="7-Lord-of-the-Rings-Online"><a href="#7-Lord-of-the-Rings-Online" class="headerlink" title="7. Lord of the Rings Online"></a><strong>7. Lord of the Rings Online</strong></h4><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> Windows, macOS</p><p>The Lord of the Rings Online is an MMORPG based in the impeccably detailed LOTR universe that is perfect for fans of medieval fantasy and Tolkien’s Lord of the Rings. With the game, players go on a journey across Middle Earth, fighting alongside familiar characters and exploring locations such as those in the movies.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/lord-of-the-rings-online-poster.jpg"                      alt=" Convert WebP to JPG"                ></p><p>There is just one small exception to the gameplay of Lord of the Rings Online, but it’s no different than any other MMORPG on this list. There are no large scale PvP opportunities in LOTR Online, since all characters in the game are on the same side. It instead provides players with a Monster Play mode that allows them to create a monster at level ten and battle other players within Ettenmoor.</p><h4 id="8-Star-Trek-Online"><a href="#8-Star-Trek-Online" class="headerlink" title="8. Star Trek Online"></a><strong>8. Star Trek Online</strong></h4><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PC</p><p>In addition to its solid license, Star Trek Online offers a rich and unique gameplay experience that is unbeatable in the MMO market. With its spaceships and aliens, and a consistent blend of third-person shooter and naval simulator, Space Truckers Online is an addictive game that will keep you hooked with its spaceships and aliens.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/star-trek-online-poster.jpg"                      alt=" Convert WebP to JPG"                ></p><p>Many familiar elements are found in the series and films that are as enjoyable to discover as they sound. Fan service is done right in Star Trek: The Original Series by blowing up borg cubes, strolling Deep Space Nine’s promenade, or beaming down to exotic planets as part of an away team. A new story expansion on the Alpha Quadrant, launching at the end of January, offers new gameplay content set in a previously unexplored sector, as well as a number of recent limited-time events and minigames.</p><h4 id="9-ArcheAge"><a href="#9-ArcheAge" class="headerlink" title="9. ArcheAge"></a><strong>9. ArcheAge</strong></h4><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> Windows, macOS</p><p>You can do pretty much anything in ArcheAge, a medieval fantasy game that takes you to a medieval fantasy world. If you want to be a powerful warrior, you can do so with a huge sword of your own and a big group of friends at your side, or you can become an economics expert and take on the challenges of farming and trade. As a pirate, you can rob traders and plunder their goods.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/archeage-poster.jpg"                      alt=" Convert WebP to JPG"                ></p><p>Additionally, Mounts and Travel play an important role in ArcheAge. On top of riding wild animals such as lions and deer across its colossal world, you can also take to the air and sea. You can sail the oceans in anything from rowboats to warships, and there are also aerial modes of transportation like gliders and airships. Archeage shows how dedicated Trion is (and the resources that they have available to them) in its polish and longevity.</p><h4 id="10-EVE-Online"><a href="#10-EVE-Online" class="headerlink" title="10. EVE Online"></a><strong>10. EVE Online</strong></h4><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> Windows, macOS</p><p>EVE Online is still the premier space MMO, and it has been the source of many memorable gaming stories, owing to the way it focuses on a few elements and excels at them. As well as meticulous simulations and systems, CCP pays attention to its dedicated community and responds appropriately, as it is often their subscribers who make the decisions.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/eve-online-poster.jpg"                      alt="eve-online-poster"                ></p><p>Although detractors dismiss EVE as spreadsheets in space, the criticism highlights one of its strongest points: its real and thriving economy. It is said that in-game intrigue has spilled over into the real world on occasion, as the corporations and alliances in EVE take their business very seriously.

How to Download and Record with Screen Recorder Pro</h2><p>The features of the application seem to be great for capturing any screen activities.

The Editor’s Review"></a>Part 3. The Editor’s Review</h2><p>Now, it is time to give you our final verdict and leave no gap between the lips and the cup.</p><p>Performance: The performance of the application is smooth and flawless. Unlike other screen recorders, it does not bring down the performance of the application whose screen you are recording. However, it does take up system resources, and for an old PC, the effect could be significant. But for a modern PC, there is no issue. Therefore, it scores really well as far as performance is concerned.</p><p>Functions: As a standalone screen recorder, the app is perfect from all aspects. Starting from recording full screen and custom screen to recording with and without cursor, all standard features and some advanced features are available. You can configure the settings as per requirements and you can take screenshots and record from webcam and microphone. However, there is no basic editing option available which is a drawback. Besides, the application is not effective in recording gameplay.</p><p>Video Quality: Video quality is standard but not advanced. The video quality cannot compete with premium screen recorder. You cannot record 4K videos and therefore, it is suitable for basic recording and not for professional recording. You cannot even enhance the video quality with editor because it does not come with any editor and it is strictly a screen recorder. All in all, if you want professional video quality, you have to look for alternatives.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=2201613&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.macdvdripperpro.com/images/devices-3.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-4-Other-Alternative-to-Record-Screen-on-Windows-10"><a href="#Part-4-Other-Alternative-to-Record-Screen-on-Windows-10" class="headerlink" title="Part 4.

The Editor’s Review"></a>Part 3. The Editor’s Review</h2><p>Now, it is time to give you our final verdict and leave no gap between the lips and the cup.</p><p>Performance: The performance of the application is smooth and flawless. Unlike other screen recorders, it does not bring down the performance of the application whose screen you are recording. However, it does take up system resources, and for an old PC, the effect could be significant. But for a modern PC, there is no issue. Therefore, it scores really well as far as performance is concerned.</p><p>Functions: As a standalone screen recorder, the app is perfect from all aspects. Starting from recording full screen and custom screen to recording with and without cursor, all standard features and some advanced features are available. You can configure the settings as per requirements and you can take screenshots and record from webcam and microphone. However, there is no basic editing option available which is a drawback. Besides, the application is not effective in recording gameplay.</p><p>Video Quality: Video quality is standard but not advanced. The video quality cannot compete with premium screen recorder. You cannot record 4K videos and therefore, it is suitable for basic recording and not for professional recording. You cannot even enhance the video quality with editor because it does not come with any editor and it is strictly a screen recorder. All in all, if you want professional video quality, you have to look for alternatives.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=22741618&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.diskpart.com/resource/images/index/dp-index-img-banner-people@2x.png"                      border="0"                >Easy and Safe Partition Software &amp; Hard Disk Manager</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-4-Other-Alternative-to-Record-Screen-on-Windows-10-1"><a href="#Part-4-Other-Alternative-to-Record-Screen-on-Windows-10-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 4.

Key Features of OBS and ShadowPlay"></a>Part 1. Key Features of OBS and ShadowPlay</h2><p>OBS and ShadowPlay are both completely free to use for recording your gameplay as well as your capturing desktop screen. OBS is open-source software and it has a cross-platform structure which is why it supports all computer operating systems. It is popular among gamers for live streaming on Twitch and YouTube.</p><p>ShadowPlay comes from Nvidia which is the largest manufacturer for GPU. That is why gamers who prefer Nvidia GPU, they have a special preference for ShadowPlay. Here are the key features of OBS and ShadowPlay you should be aware of.</p><h3 id="OBS-Studio"><a href="#OBS-Studio" class="headerlink" title="OBS Studio"></a><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >OBS Studio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/record-sims4-obs.jpg"                      alt="obs studio"                ></p><p><strong>Screen Capture</strong> - You can capture high-quality gameplay when you play games on your computer as well as on a gaming console. You can tweak the parameters on video quality so that you can get the recording just like you want.</p><p><strong>Webcam Capture</strong> - OBS lets you add webcam as an overlay so that you can record your gameplay as well as show your reaction so that the recording is more interactive and engaging. You can also use green screen setup to make the video more professional and eye-catching.</p><p><strong>Better Audio</strong> - You can record your game sound as well as your voice from external mic. This is useful for voiceover and live commentary to make the video interesting and showcase your personality traits verbally. There are also audio filters, audio mixers, and audio effects available to apply.</p><p><strong>Advanced Editor</strong> - The built-in editing software allows performing different post-recording tasks like sharpening, cropping, and color correction. It has advanced filters that enable Chroma keying, image masking, and color correction.</p><p><strong>Easy Switching</strong> - It comes with a one-click solution for switching between transitions and scenes. The tool can be perfect for going back and forth between games and devices. You can also add multiple screens and audio sources as required.</p><p>Most importantly, you can live stream your gameplay on almost any online video streaming platform.</p><h3 id="Nvidia-ShadowPlay"><a href="#Nvidia-ShadowPlay" class="headerlink" title="Nvidia ShadowPlay"></a>Nvidia ShadowPlay</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shadowplay-record.jpg"                      alt="shadowplay"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4599951&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><iframe width="864" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jVnfr5HudQw" title="The Latest and Easiest Solution to Remove Kindle DRM on Windows (without Degrading)" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><br>Epubor Ultimate for Win：Helps you read books anywhere, including the best eBook Converter + eBook DRM Removal functions.</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><strong>Gameplay Capture</strong> - ShadowPlay lets you record gameplay at 8K with 30FPS. This is unmatched by any free video recording software. You can also record gameplay at 4K HDR with 60FPS. It comes with hardware acceleration to ensure the performance does not get affected while recording in the background.</p><p><strong>Instant Replay</strong> - ShadowPlay keeps recording in the background and therefore, if something important has happened in the game, you can get the last 30 seconds of instant replay clip and you can share it anywhere you want. This is highly useful to share short clips on social media platforms.</p><p><strong>ShadowPlay Highlights</strong> - The feature will automatically record the best gaming moments and create a perfect highlight video. This is useful when you want to upload the best parts of the gameplay rather than the entire part.</p><p><strong>Screenshots</strong> - ShadowPlay lets you capture 8K screenshots of your game that you can use as thumbnails for your videos as well as put them up on social media platforms.</p><p><strong>GIF Creator</strong> - With ShadowPlay, you don’t have to leave the game to create GIFs. You can create high-quality GIFs of duration 15 seconds. You can also add text to the GIFs and share anything you want.</p><p>Just like OBS, ShadowPlay enables you to broadcast gameplay in real-time on YouTube Live, Twitch, and Facebook Live.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Comparison-ShadowPlay-vs-OBS"><a href="#Part-2-Comparison-ShadowPlay-vs-OBS" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Comparison ShadowPlay vs OBS"></a>Part 2. Comparison ShadowPlay vs OBS</h2><p>Here are the key points of differences between OBS and ShadowPlay that will help you decide between OBS or ShadowPlay.</p><p><strong>ShadowPlay vs OBS</strong> <strong>Recording:</strong></p><p>While recording, OBS allows faster processing of the recorded video files. Besides, it can compress the file size during the encoding process so that the recorded video files take relatively less space. This makes it ideal for longer sessions of gameplay recording. However, in the process, OBS can reduce the frame rate significantly, and hence, the video may not be as smooth as you expect it to be. Therefore, OBS is suitable for regular game recording where not much compression is required.</p><p>On the contrary, ShadowPlay does not reduce the file size or frame rate, and hence, it is a great choice for high-end games where you need the recorded to be as smooth as possible. However, ShadowPlay requires more space on the hard drive. When you upload on video streaming platforms, there will be some automatic compression. Therefore, the less compression you do during your encoding phase, the better will be the output.</p><p><strong>ShadowPlay vs OBS Performance:</strong></p><p>OBS uses significant CPU power and resources. This is one of the reasons why it reduces the frame rate while recording to use less CPU resources. In fact, it can affect the game performance if you are playing and recording a high-end game. However, you can customize various configuration parameters to reduce its burden on CPU performance.</p><p>ShadowPlay does not affect the CPU performance as it comes with hardware acceleration. It supports higher frame rates for high-end games as well. If at all, it can bring about 5%-10% effect on CPU performance which is almost ignorable in comparison to OBS.</p><p><strong>ShadowPlay vs OBS File Format</strong>:</p><p>OBS consumes less space for recorded videos. It compresses the format which can drastically reduce the output file size. The best thing about OBS is that it comes with the NVENC hardware encoded chip that allows choosing from different supported file formats.</p><p>On the contrary, ShadowPlay supports MP4 formats by default which makes it require more space. It uses  codec. MP4 file format is the most popular video file format that you can play across all media players and upload on online platforms.</p><p><strong>ShadowPlay vs OBS Live Streaming</strong>:</p><p>You cannot live stream as well as record on ShadowPlay. This is a major drawback that OBS has overcome. That is why most gamers prefer OBS Studio for live streaming as they can record the gaming session for future reference. If you want to just broadcast your gameplay, ShadowPlay is good enough. But if you want to have multiple scenes and overlay adjustments in live streaming, OBS is the best choice.</p><p><strong>ShadowPlay vs OBS Editing:</strong></p><p>OBS offers better editing options thanks to its built-in editor. Starting customizable transitions to real-time editing before broadcasting, OBS has different editing scopes tailor-made for gamers. On the contrary, ShadowPlay has very limited editing options as the main focus is on recording only. But if we talk about true video editing, both applications are still underdeveloped on this front.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.emeditor.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4631722&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.emeditor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/frontpage2-2048x588.webp"                      border="0"                >EmEditor Professional (Lifetime License, non-store app)</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-Alternative-Way-To-Record-Games"><a href="#Part-3-Alternative-Way-To-Record-Games" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

The Enterprise video market’s current size exceeds $16 billion and it is expected to reach $40 billion by 2022.

Allowing other team members to edit a video, requires you to assign a new owner.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/microsoft-stream-video-privacy-permission.jpg"                      alt="Microsoft Stream"                ></p><p>The platform allows you to keep your videos private and available only to users that have a password.</p><h4 id="Step-5-Captions-and-Subtitle"><a href="#Step-5-Captions-and-Subtitle" class="headerlink" title="Step 5 - Captions and Subtitle"></a>Step 5 - Captions and Subtitle</h4><p>The Options tab enables you to add captions to a video or upload subtitles. The Video Language feature helps the platform generate captions for all videos automatically, and if you want to upload a subtitle or a caption you’ll need to make sure that they are in the WebVTT file format.</p><h4 id="Step-6-Sharing-and-Publishing-videos"><a href="#Step-6-Sharing-and-Publishing-videos" class="headerlink" title="Step 6 - Sharing and Publishing videos"></a>Step 6 - Sharing and Publishing videos</h4><p>Once you’ve edited the metadata, you can either click on the Publish Now or Share buttons. Clicking on the Publish Now option will start the upload process, and when the video is online it will be shared with everyone you selected.</p><p>The Share feature enables you to create a link, by sharing it on an enterprise social network such as Yammer. The link can then be used to share the video on all other social media. If you would like to make further adjustments to the video’s metadata, you can do so by selecting the My Videos option in the My Content menu, and clicking on the Edit option.</p><h2 id="How-to-Manage-Videos-in-Microsoft-Stream"><a href="#How-to-Manage-Videos-in-Microsoft-Stream" class="headerlink" title="How to Manage Videos in Microsoft Stream?"></a>How to Manage Videos in Microsoft Stream?</h2><p>All content you upload to Microsoft Stream will be displayed on My Videos page, and you can edit the metadata, filter, or browse through the videos as well as add videos to channels and groups. The portal enables you to sort out your videos based on different parameters such as view count or publish date, to name a few, which means that you can organize your video collection most functionally.</p><p>Editing metadata requires you to go to a group, channel, or My Videos page, click on the More button, and select the Edit option. You can then change the descriptions, hashtags, or any other metadata and improve the video’s search rankings on the platform.</p><p>Global administrators and group owners can change the settings of the groups they run. Name, descriptions, or the privacy status can be changed in all groups you manage, and the Delete option is also available if you want to erase a group. In order to do this, you only have to navigate to the group you’re managing and click on the Settings icon.</p><h3 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h3><p>Microsoft Stream is still a young platform that facilitates corporate communications through videos. Its features include password protection and amazing sharing options that enable you to distribute a video to an entire company. However, the portal lacks some of the key tools that make communication within an organization easier. Stream’s users can’t capture webcam footage or broadcast live streams, but Microsoft has already announced that many upgrades are in store and that this business-oriented video sharing portal is going to continue to get better.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"
