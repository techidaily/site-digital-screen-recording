The PlayStation 2 was released to compete with Nintendo’s SNES, which ruled the console video-gaming market for years. Sony launched its first-ever gaming console after years of reorganizations and partnerships, including ones with Nintendo. The console was immensely successful until its successor replaced it.</p><p>With the PS1 emulator for PC, you can play PlayStation 1 games. Play your favorite PlayStation games on your computer with the original BIOS, your own BIOS, and your own games. Listed below, you will find some of the best PS1 emulators that will allow you to relive those days. If you have an original game disk, even better. All you need is a copy of the disc image.</p><h3 id="1-RetroArch-Emulator"><a href="#1-RetroArch-Emulator" class="headerlink" title="1.RetroArch Emulator"></a>1.RetroArch Emulator</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/retroarch-emulator-ps1.png"                      alt="retroarch-emulator-ps1"                ></p><p>This emulator offers a variety of solutions and is just an emulator for playing PS1 video games, making it one of the best ps 1 emulators and most complete emulators. The first stable version was released in the year 2020, almost a decade after its launch in the year 2010. On top of all that, it is free, open-source, and can emulate gaming consoles, media players, game engines, and others. That makes it a very reliable emulator.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li>Multiple platforms are supported, such as Windows, Linux, and macOS.</li><li>As a fast, portable, lightweight emulator, RetroArch requires no adjustments or very little tweaking to run and function properly.</li><li>In terms of game-saving, refresh rate, game loading, and screen resolution, it is one of the best PS1 emulators out there.</li></ul><h3 id="2-Matsu-Emulator"><a href="#2-Matsu-Emulator" class="headerlink" title="2.Matsu Emulator"></a>2.Matsu Emulator</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/matsu-emulator-ps1.png"                      alt="matsu-emulator-ps1"                ></p><p>There is also the Matsu Emulator, which is based on the PSX&#x2F;PSOne platform. Despite being one of the best emulators in the world, it is also quite stable and safe. There are more and more features being added to the software. In contrast, the simulator works well but the free version has heavy advertising. If you purchase the pro edition in the game, you will be able to remove the advertisements. If you would like to pay someone for an emulator, we would recommend ePSXe or FPse. You will find Matsu Emulator to be a reliable and efficient program if you can endure its commercials.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li>It features an on-screen virtual keypad as well as support for gamepads.</li><li>The sound quality is excellent.</li><li>As well as fast-forwarding, it also supports rewinding.</li><li>Up to 16 slots can be used by the Matsu emulator.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2037355/7443" target="_top" id="2037355">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2037355" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2037355/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-Mednafen"><a href="#3-Mednafen" class="headerlink" title="3.Mednafen"></a>3.Mednafen</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mednafen-poster-ps1.png"                      alt="mednafen-poster-ps1"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1484910/16446" target="_top" id="1484910">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1484910" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1484910/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Games are run using OpenGL and SDL in Mednafen, a multi-system emulator.

The Editor’s Review"></a>Part 3. The Editor’s Review</h2><p>Now, it is time to give you our final verdict and leave no gap between the lips and the cup.</p><p>Performance: The performance of the application is smooth and flawless. Unlike other screen recorders, it does not bring down the performance of the application whose screen you are recording. However, it does take up system resources, and for an old PC, the effect could be significant. But for a modern PC, there is no issue. Therefore, it scores really well as far as performance is concerned.</p><p>Functions: As a standalone screen recorder, the app is perfect from all aspects. Starting from recording full screen and custom screen to recording with and without cursor, all standard features and some advanced features are available. You can configure the settings as per requirements and you can take screenshots and record from webcam and microphone. However, there is no basic editing option available which is a drawback. Besides, the application is not effective in recording gameplay.</p><p>Video Quality: Video quality is standard but not advanced. The video quality cannot compete with premium screen recorder. You cannot record 4K videos and therefore, it is suitable for basic recording and not for professional recording. You cannot even enhance the video quality with editor because it does not come with any editor and it is strictly a screen recorder. All in all, if you want professional video quality, you have to look for alternatives.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Other-Alternative-to-Record-Screen-on-Windows-10"><a href="#Part-4-Other-Alternative-to-Record-Screen-on-Windows-10" class="headerlink" title="Part 4.

Therefore, you do not need separate applications for recording the screen and editing out video like a pro.

You can configure the settings as per requirements and you can take screenshots and record from webcam and microphone. However, there is no basic editing option available which is a drawback. Besides, the application is not effective in recording gameplay.</p><p>Video Quality: Video quality is standard but not advanced. The video quality cannot compete with premium screen recorder. You cannot record 4K videos and therefore, it is suitable for basic recording and not for professional recording. You cannot even enhance the video quality with editor because it does not come with any editor and it is strictly a screen recorder.

It’s similar to taking a screenshot on a computer when the Print Screen option is available. You can crop out the unwanted parts by snipping out the part of the image you want from the screen.</p><p>When taking screenshots, a Chromebook may be a little different from a Windows or Mac computer. Whether you use the native method or a third-party tool, the process is the same.</p><p>It’s easy to grab any area of the screen using the keyboard commands, whether it’s the entire screen or just a portion. Nonetheless, if this method does not meet your needs, you can find a suitable third-party alternative. This article will show you how you can take screenshots using the keyboard shortcuts on a Chromebook. Furthermore, we will also discuss some of the best Chromebook snipping tools that you can use to get the job done.</p><h2 id="Best-Snipping-Tools-Chromebook"><a href="#Best-Snipping-Tools-Chromebook" class="headerlink" title="Best Snipping Tools Chromebook"></a><strong>Best Snipping Tools Chromebook</strong></h2><p>Using keyboard shortcuts is the easiest way to take a screenshot of your Chromebook screen.</p><p>By pressing CTRL+Window Switch (Show Windows), you can capture your Chromebook’s entire screen. Holding CTRL+Shift and pressing the Window Switch (Show Windows) key, select the area you want to capture, then drag the crosshair icon from the trackpad.</p><p>Use the stylus with your Chromebook to take full or partial screenshots and annotate, or use the Power+Volume Down buttons to snap a quick screenshot. Even though Chromebook’s snipping tool is a bit lacking, there are a number of Chrome extensions and apps that can improve it. Check out the list below.</p><h3 id="1-LightShot"><a href="#1-LightShot" class="headerlink" title="1.LightShot"></a>1.LightShot</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/lightshot-poster.png"                      alt="lightshot-poster"                ></p><p>Chromebook users can use LightShot for free, and Windows and Mac users can use it too.

Key Features of SplitCam"></a>2. Key Features of SplitCam</h2><p>Even though it is a completely free video recorder, there are loads of useful features for the users. Here are the key features of SplitCam that you should be aware of.</p><p>Record From Different Sources – You can record webcam video, desktop screen, IP camera, web browser screen, as well as your gameplay. Besides, you can record audio from different sources. In fact, you can record another video, image, PDF document, slideshow, and much more in the background.</p><p>Video Effects – There are loads of video effects available to apply to webcam videos. Besides, there are realistic 3D masks available, and you can replace heads and faces with 3D objects. This will enhance the video content and allow you to create fun videos.</p><p>Live Streaming: With Splitcam, you can live stream to different video services like Justin.tv, UStream, and Livestream instantly. Besides, SplitCam allows you to use webcam with several applications without any issue. You can also upload your video to YouTube instantly.</p><p>Useful Features: The zoom feature is really great for highlighting the needed part. When you are making explanatory video, the zooming feature is a necessity for everyone to focus on the right part. Besides, you can capture screenshots instead of video as well. The software also shows the performance parameters for better understanding.</p><p>HD recording – SplitCam lets you record the desired video from any video source as per the video resolution you need. The software supports up to 2048x1536 video resolution. You can adjust brightness, contrast, saturation, sharpen, and other parameters to enhance the video quality.</p><p>Moreover, you can use hotkeys to operate the software smoothly, and the user interface is quite simple and easy to operate.</p><h2 id="3-In-depth-Review"><a href="#3-In-depth-Review" class="headerlink" title="3. In-depth Review"></a>3. In-depth Review</h2><p>Let us move on to the detailed SplitCam review and analyze how it performs on the parameters that matter the most.</p><p>Performance: SplitCam is not as heavy an application as some of the professional video recorders. Hence, it does not put much pressure on CPU resource. Since the video recording quality is restricted, even at the highest resolution, performance is smooth.</p><p>Video Quality: The video quality is restricted to maximum of 2048x1536 resolution. Therefore, you cannot shoot 4K videos even though your webcam or desktop screen has 4K resolution. Hence, there is a scope for improvement in video quality which is why users look for other SplitCam similar software.</p><p>Support Devices: You can record your external webcam, desktop screen, as well as IP camera. Besides, it supports NDI devices. However, the software is only available for Windows 7 and Windows 10.</p><p>Editing Options: There are different customization options available for adjusting video parameters such as brightness, saturation, and even skin smoother. However, it lacks editing options post-recording so that you could take the video to the next level.</p><h2 id="4-Best-Alternative"><a href="#4-Best-Alternative" class="headerlink" title="4.

Also, you need some software that would get you the frames and not a hazy or impromptu screenshot.

Video Frame Capture: QuickTime Player [Free]"></a>2. Video Frame Capture: QuickTime Player [Free]</h3><p>You can consider QuickTime Player. It is available for free on Mac. It is the default application in Apple devices, particularly the Mac. You can record whatever’s on screen. You can also record the audio by using the microphone. You can record the full screen or a part of the screen. The instructions are easy and you can also use the camera on the Mac to capture external video using the application.</p><p>However, QuickTime Player is not ideal for screen grabs and editing or other processes are quite complicated. This is not the best solution for video frame capture.</p><p>Check out <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >3 popular ways for taking screenshot on Mac <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h3 id="3-Video-Frame-Capture-ScreenFlow-99"><a href="#3-Video-Frame-Capture-ScreenFlow-99" class="headerlink" title="3. Video Frame Capture: ScreenFlow ($99)"></a>3. Video Frame Capture: ScreenFlow ($99)</h3><p>You can try ScreenFlow. It costs $99. You can not only initiate video frame capture but can also grab a screenshot of anything that’s on your desktop. You can zoom and crop what you have captured. There are some special features like callouts and annotations. The ScreenFlow app that is now available works in sync with iPhoto and iTunes.</p><p>The trouble is that much free software offers the same features as ScreenFlow so spending a hundred bucks doesn’t make sense.</p><h3 id="4-Video-Frame-Capture-Snagit-25"><a href="#4-Video-Frame-Capture-Snagit-25" class="headerlink" title="4.

It costs $25. It is not for amateurs. Capturing a screenshot is relatively simple and you also get features to help you insert the screenshot into articles or blog posts. But the interface is a little messy. In an attempt to make raw footage or captured frames readily accessible, the software really crowds up the tray. Also, despite being a paid solution it doesn’t have features to help you add connotations or titles.</p><h3 id="5-Video-Frame-Capture-Monosnap-Free"><a href="#5-Video-Frame-Capture-Monosnap-Free" class="headerlink" title="5. Video Frame Capture: Monosnap [Free]"></a>5. Video Frame Capture: Monosnap [Free]</h3><p>This is a free solution. It works better with short videos and quick snapshots. It is light, easy to use and it can work in sync with the integrated camera and microphone of your Mac. You can use your cloud storage to keep your screenshots or captured frames. Where Monosnap falters is the edit suite. There are very few edit features. All you can do is crop the frame you have captured.

These days, it’s all too common for gamers to have to clear their hard drives when a new game is released.</p><p>Games like Call of Duty see the astonishing patch sizes: Warzone lately may mean you can only update a game rather than get a new one, and still, you’ll run out of space. It is possible to store hundreds of games using an external hard drive, making them available to you without downloading them again.</p><p>You will still need more storage, though an SSD is more efficient and recommended if you buy the Xbox Series S or Series X.</p><p>If you’re looking for a bit more space, we’ve created a list of the best Xbox external hard drives.</p><h2 id="Best-Xbox-External-Hard-Drive-in-2024"><a href="#Best-Xbox-External-Hard-Drive-in-2024" class="headerlink" title="Best Xbox External Hard Drive in 2024"></a><strong>Best Xbox External Hard Drive in 2024</strong></h2><h4 id="1-Seagate-2TB-Xbox-Game-Drive"><a href="#1-Seagate-2TB-Xbox-Game-Drive" class="headerlink" title="1.

With this drive, you get a standard Seagate drive in a flashier case. The (admittedly quite nice) embossed Xbox logo and official green case are an additional $15-20. It’s a great choice if the price is right for you, and aesthetics are a concern. Esthetics are important to me, so I think this is the best choice. As often happens around big retail events, Seagate’s 2TB Game Drive in official Xbox green often drops in price, so though this is a great time to buy, we can expect further savings in the coming months.</p><p><strong>Price:</strong></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01065S79E/" >Check on Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li>Fast and Reliable</li><li>Vast Storage of 2TB</li><li>Compatible with different versions of Xbox.</li><li>It is a value for money hard drive.</li></ul><h4 id="2-WD-Black-P10-1-5TB-Game-Drive"><a href="#2-WD-Black-P10-1-5TB-Game-Drive" class="headerlink" title="2.

The metal topside gives it a bit of a shipping container aesthetic even though it’s not listed as an armored or “rugged” hard drive. The hard drive remains cool even after extensive usage and runs quietly without making any noise.</p><p>Although the drive’s write speed is not special at 130 megabytes per second, we found that it matched the console’s internal hard drive, So you can run the games directly from the hard drive without worrying about any lags or delays.</p><p>The best thing about this hard drive is that you can find it with different storage capacities ranging from 1Tb to 5Tb. So, the users have the option to choose suitable storage options according to their needs.</p><p> <strong>Price:</strong></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/WD%5FBlack-Drive-External-Compatible-WDBA3A0050BBK-WESN/dp/B07VNTFHD5" >Check On Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong>Features</strong>:</p><ul><li>It is extremely portable</li><li>Always runs quietly and cool</li><li>The 3-year warranty is quite reasonable.</li><li>Price is high but is value for money.</li></ul><h4 id="3-Toshiba-1TB-Canvio-Advance"><a href="#3-Toshiba-1TB-Canvio-Advance" class="headerlink" title="3.

With a sleek, glossy design, a simple, elegant design, and a nice blue power-light on top, the Toshiba Canvio Advance is an attractive piece of kit. Works just fine. All the drives on this list match its read and write speeds, and it comes with a two-year warranty. Your Xbox console has a USB port that you can connect to, and proceed as usual…</p><p>Additionally, suppose you want to use it for PCs as well. In that case, it includes password protection and automatic backup of files, both of which make it a better budget pick than our previous budget pick, the Canvio Basics. There is only one real disadvantage to the Advance: it does not come in green, so you cannot match it with your console. Nonetheless, white looks slick next to many Xbox consoles. You cannot beat the price of the 1TB version, which is around $50 &#x2F; £50.</p><p><strong>Price:</strong></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Toshiba-Canvio-Advance-Portable-External/dp/B08JKFY8FH/" >Check On Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li>Small and Compact In Size</li><li>Available in multiple colors.</li><li>Extremely affordable.</li><li>Standard speed but matches to that of your console.</li></ul><h4 id="4-Seagate-Expansion-8TB"><a href="#4-Seagate-Expansion-8TB" class="headerlink" title="4.

This is the ideal choice for those who use their Xbox Ones often and don’t want to worry about storage in the future. It is more expensive and requires an external power adapter (supplied), but it is a surprising device for its size. Seagate’s Expansion 8TB weighs 2.09 lbs and is considerably lighter than large rival capacity external hard drives, including the WD 8TB My Book drive, which weighs 2.9 lbs and measures 1.9 x 5.5 x 6.7 in.</p><p><strong>Price:</strong></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.in/dp/B01HAPGEIE?tag=georiot-in-default-21&ascsubtag=grd-row-1888675391884567800-20&geniuslink=true" >View on Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li>A vast amount of storage space</li><li>Excellent value</li><li>It needs to be plugged into the mains due to its size and capacity</li><li>A bit large but the capacity is great.</li></ul><h4 id="5-OWC-Envoy-Pro-EX-SSD"><a href="#5-OWC-Envoy-Pro-EX-SSD" class="headerlink" title="5.

Its high-ish price tag is due to this and the fact that it’s an SSD, but the quality you get is undeniable.</p><p>In terms of technology, this is a wonderful piece of kit: a sleek, stylish, silver wedge-shaped drive with a single LED and one connection port that is very robust and pocket-sized. Despite being small, it feels solid and can survive bumps and drops as long as it is handled with care. Despite its size, it’s impressively stylish - for a hard drive - and can be hidden behind a gaming console.</p><p>Using the software on board, you can turn it into a PC external drive without a problem. This is also how we uncovered 411Mbps read speed and 248Mbps write speed using Crystal Disk Mark.

It could be that the video has been taken at the wrong angle or you want to watch the video at a certain angle from a different perspective. The most common reason is that the video is taken in portrait mode and it looks small on your computer screen with black screen on both sides and you want to rotate the video to landscape mode. Here are the steps to perform VLC rotate video.</p><p>Step 1: Open VLC Media Player.</p><p>Step 2: Go to Media &gt; Open File option and select the video file that you want to rotate.</p><p>Step 3: Once the video opens, go to Tools &gt; Effects and Filters option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlc-tools-option.jpg"                      alt="vlc tools option"                ></p><p>Step 4: From Adjustments and Effects window, go to Video Effects tab.</p><p>Step 5: Under Video Effects tab, go to Geometry tab.</p><p>Step 6: Check Transform option and from the drop-down menu, select the required options.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlc-adjustments-effects.jpg"                      alt="vlc adjustments and effects"                ></p><p>The options available are – rotate by 90 degrees, 180 degrees, 270 degrees, flip horizontally or vertically, transport and anti-transpose.</p><p>Step 7: If you want to rotate the video at any desired angle, you can check Rotate option and select the desired angle from the dial.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlc-video-effects.jpg"                      alt="vlc video effects"                ></p><p>Step 8: Finally, click on Save button and then on Close button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/save-rotated-video-vlc.jpg"                      alt="save rotated video vlc"                ></p><p>Now, you will get to see the video as per your selected angle instantly. But note that this VLC rotate effect will stay with VLC and if you open any other video file, it will also be displayed as per your selected angle. In order to disable this rotation effect, follow the same steps and this time, uncheck Transform and Rotate options.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Rotate-Video-in-VLC-on-Mac"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Rotate-Video-in-VLC-on-Mac" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.
