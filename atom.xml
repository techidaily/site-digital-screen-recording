Google Meet, Zoom, and Microsoft Teams are free to use, and although they charge for extra functions, there aren’t additional costs for virtual background. We’ve contributed know-how to ensure your guests only focus on you and not what’s behind your back.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/zoom-blur-background.jpg"                      alt="zoom blur background"                ></p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: What to Consider Before Blurring the Background in Zoom?</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: How to Blur the Background in Zoom: A Step-by-Step Guide</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: How to blur the background of any video?</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-What-to-Consider-Before-Blurring-the-Background-in-Zoom"><a href="#Part-1-What-to-Consider-Before-Blurring-the-Background-in-Zoom" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What to Consider Before Blurring the Background in Zoom?"></a><strong>Part 1: What to Consider Before Blurring the Background in Zoom?</strong></h2><p>Zoom can blur everything in the screen’s background with the tap of a button, which can save you from uploading an image to hide your screen’s background. Here’s how to get started before you learn how to blur the background in Zoom.</p><h4 id="1-–-Here-to-look-for-the-blue-background-on-Zoom"><a href="#1-–-Here-to-look-for-the-blue-background-on-Zoom" class="headerlink" title="1 – Here to look for the blue background on Zoom"></a>1 – Here to look for the blue background on Zoom</h4><p>Primarily, make sure that you are looking at your laptop’s Zoom Client. First, open Zoom; tap the <strong>Settings</strong> icon at the top right corner. From there, select “<strong>Backgrounds and Filters</strong>” in the sidebar popup. Then, follow our step-by-step guide to blur Zoom background from there.</p><h4 id="2-–-Update-Zoom-to-get-the-Blur-Background"><a href="#2-–-Update-Zoom-to-get-the-Blur-Background" class="headerlink" title="2 – Update Zoom to get the Blur Background"></a>2 – Update Zoom to get the Blur Background</h4><p>Ensure that the computer system is up to date and supports the latest version of Zoom.

Top keyboard makers are constantly pushing the boundaries of speed, design, material, and functionality. High pricing is inevitable as a result of this competitiveness. But don’t be concerned! So you don’t have to break the bank, we’ve compiled a list of the best gaming keyboard under 100$. This article is ideal for individuals on a budget who are searching for high-quality mechanical boards.</p><p>We evaluated many choices, starting at $36, and tested the many types of keyboard that delivered excellent value for money — somewhat unexpectedly, the cheapest option was the one we wouldn’t suggest. A new gaming keyboard may make a significant impact if you are starting to work from home or just playing more PC games than you did a few months ago.</p><p>Getting the proper gaming keyboard, like getting the proper gaming mouse, comes down to personal preference — from comfortability (wrist rest) about whether you would like RGB Lights, mechanical buttons, tactile feedback, configurable keys, separate media keys, or a slew of other features we can’t begin to list. Also, check out our dictionary of keyboard terminology to help you narrow down your design choices.</p><h3 id="1-Corsair-RGB-K55-XT-PRO"><a href="#1-Corsair-RGB-K55-XT-PRO" class="headerlink" title="1.Corsair RGB K55 XT PRO"></a>1.Corsair RGB K55 XT PRO</h3><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.nero.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=42296985&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/9cea886b9f44a3c2df1163730ab64994/products/copy_nero_burning_rom_cart.png"                      border="0"                ><br></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/corsair-rgb-k55-xt-pro.jpg"                      alt="corsair-rgb-k55-xt-pro"                ></p><p>The Corsair K55 RGB PRO XT is the best gaming keyboard for under 100$ with non-mechanical buttons. It features rubber dome buttons, unlike most of the other keyboards on this list. They’re a little heavier to push than traditional mechanical keyboards, and they don’t provide the same haptic feedback, and they’re still light enough to satisfy gamers.</p><p>It’s jam-packed with gaming features, including the ability to assign macros to any key and six additional macro keys just on the left side. It features complete RGB illumination and individually illuminated keys, which you can configure using the iCUE software, available for Windows and macOS. The latency is also quite minimal, which is fantastic. The keyboard includes one inclination setting and wrist rest. Thus it shouldn’t be too tiring to use for extended gaming sessions.</p><h5 id="Pros"><a href="#Pros" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h5><p>Its keys are very quiet</p><p>finest gaming keyboard with non-mechanical keys</p><h5 id="Cons"><a href="#Cons" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h5><p>Its typing quality is low</p><p>The ABS keycaps are slick and unstable, which leads to inadvertent key presses</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=40085955&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/f702defbc67edb455949f46babab0c18/products/2_logo9.png"                      border="0"                >FX PRO (Gold Robot + Silver Robot(Basic Package))</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-EVGA-Z12"><a href="#2-EVGA-Z12" class="headerlink" title="2.EVGA Z12"></a>2.EVGA Z12</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/evga-z12.png"                      alt="evga-z12"                ></p><p>Look at the EVGA Z12 if you want something even cheaper. The unique EVGA Waterproof rubber dome buttons are lighter to push than Corsair RBG K55 PRO XT. Therefore gaming isn’t as responsive. They have a smaller pre-travel distance, which means they type more accurately. This is a good option if you are searching for the best gaming keyboard under 100$.</p><h5 id="Pros-1"><a href="#Pros-1" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h5><p>Five macro keys and each one is reprogrammed.</p><p>Separate media buttons.</p><p>Full-size keyboard.</p><h5 id="Cons-1"><a href="#Cons-1" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h5><p>It is zone-lit rather than RGB.</p><p>The keyboard also lacks onboard memory.</p><p>Gaming isn’t as responsive.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.massmailsoftware.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=1047974&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/dc87c13749315c7217cdc4ac692e704c/banera_for_partners-04_%281%29.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-G413-Logitech"><a href="#3-G413-Logitech" class="headerlink" title="3.G413 Logitech"></a>3.G413 Logitech</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/g413-logitech.png"                      alt="g413-logitech"                ></p><p>A good keyboard with excellent gaming performance should appeal to the majority of entry-level gamers. We can say Logitech’s G413 is the best gaming keyboard under 100$. Despite its low price, it is well-made, with a plastic body and a strong metal top half so that you will have no problems with it.</p><p>Only patented Romer-G Tactile switches are included, which feature a short pre-travel distance and provide excellent tactile feedback without being too heavy to write on. ABS keycaps feel pleasant to touch and seem to be solid. Thus the keyboard provides excellent typing quality. It offers minimal latency for gamers. Therefore you won’t even notice any lag when playing. It features individually illuminated keys and illumination. However, it’s only offered in red.</p><h5 id="Pros-2"><a href="#Pros-2" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h5><p>Macros can be assigned to any of the function keys.</p><p>You can store your settings using the G HUB Logitech online sync feature if you wish to use them on a different computer.</p><p>The best inexpensive keyboard you can buy.</p><h5 id="Cons-2"><a href="#Cons-2" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h5><p>The keyboard also lacks onboard memory</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ship7com.pxf.io/c/5597632/1509856/17634" target="_top" id="1509856"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17634-1509856"                      border="0" alt="" width="730" height="383"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="4-Z15-EVGA"><a href="#4-Z15-EVGA" class="headerlink" title="4.Z15 EVGA"></a>4.Z15 EVGA</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/z15-evga.png"                      alt="z15-evga"                ></p><p>The EVGA Z15 is the best gaming keyboard under 100$ with mechanical keys that we’ve tested. It’s an excellent gaming keyboard featuring a few extra functions to enhance your gaming experience. It’s full-size, with a sturdy frame and superior quality finishing, but still, ABS keycaps aren’t as comfortable as PBT.</p><p>It comes with vertical Kailh Speed Silver and Kailh clicky Speed Bronze keys, both of which we tried, and it’s hot-swappable so that you can use anything you like. Our unit’s clicky ones feature a short pre-travel range and low operational force, making them easy to push for gaming. The delay is also quite common, thus there should be no noticeable lag when gaming. The EVGA Release RGB software allows you to remap all keys, but it isn’t as user-friendly as other rival manufacturers’ software.</p><h5 id="Pros-3"><a href="#Pros-3" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h5><p>Keyboard is best suited to gaming.</p><p>It’s a straightforward keyboard with excellent ergonomics and comfy wrist rest.</p><h5 id="Cons-3"><a href="#Cons-3" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h5><p>The keys are too touchy for typing.</p><p>Keys can be noisy in a noisy setting.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://turtlebeacheu.sjv.io/c/5597632/1996818/23722" target="_top" id="1996818"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/23722-1996818"                      border="0" alt="" width="600" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1996818/23722"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="5-Corsair-K63"><a href="#5-Corsair-K63" class="headerlink" title="5.Corsair K63"></a>5.Corsair K63</h3><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/c/5597632/398457/3022" target="_top" id="398457"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/3022-398457"                      border="0" alt="www.sentrypc.com" width="980" height="120"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/i/5597632/398457/3022"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/corsair-k63.jpg"                      alt="corsair-k63"                ></p><p>Corsair K63 is the best gaming keyboard under 100$ with the wireless link we’ve tested. This mechanical TenKeyLess variant may connect to up to 2 different devices at the same time, either through the USB receiver or over Bluetooth. The ergonomics are excellent since it’s a horizontal keyboard with just one inclination option. However, the wrist rest looks cheap.</p><p>Only linear MX Red Cherry keys are available, which take little effort to activate and provide no tactile feedback. Although the pre-travel length is somewhat greater than that of comparable gaming keyboards, the switches are still extremely sensitive and should not cause fatigue. You can reprogram or assign macros to any key, and it has some additional features like dedicated media buttons and a Windows lockout that stops you from inadvertently minimizing your game.</p><h5 id="Pros-4"><a href="#Pros-4" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h5><p>The quality and reliability are just adequate since the frame is composed of cheap-feeling plastic.</p><h5 id="Cons-4"><a href="#Cons-4" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h5><p>The illumination is limited to single blue color.</p><h4 id="Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Wondershare Filmora"></a>Wondershare Filmora</h4><p>Get started easily with Filmora’s powerful performance, intuitive interface, and countless effects!</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Learn More &gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://neveragain.allstatics.com/2019/assets/image/box/filmora-9.png"                                     ></p><p>The Corsair K55 RGB PRO XT is the best gaming keyboard for under 100$ with non-mechanical buttons.

Thus it shouldn’t be too tiring to use for extended gaming sessions.</p><h5 id="Pros-15"><a href="#Pros-15" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h5><p>Its keys are very quiet</p><p>finest gaming keyboard with non-mechanical keys</p><h5 id="Cons-15"><a href="#Cons-15" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h5><p>Its typing quality is low</p><p>The ABS keycaps are slick and unstable, which leads to inadvertent key presses</p><h3 id="2-EVGA-Z12-3"><a href="#2-EVGA-Z12-3" class="headerlink" title="2.EVGA Z12"></a>2.EVGA Z12</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/evga-z12.png"                      alt="evga-z12"                ></p><p>Look at the EVGA Z12 if you want something even cheaper. The unique EVGA Waterproof rubber dome buttons are lighter to push than Corsair RBG K55 PRO XT. Therefore gaming isn’t as responsive. They have a smaller pre-travel distance, which means they type more accurately. This is a good option if you are searching for the best gaming keyboard under 100$.</p><h5 id="Pros-16"><a href="#Pros-16" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h5><p>Five macro keys and each one is reprogrammed.</p><p>Separate media buttons.</p><p>Full-size keyboard.</p><h5 id="Cons-16"><a href="#Cons-16" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h5><p>It is zone-lit rather than RGB.</p><p>The keyboard also lacks onboard memory.</p><p>Gaming isn’t as responsive.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.nero.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=42570605&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="http://cdnwww.nero.com/nero-com-wAssets/img/banners/2023/usbXcopy/Nero_USB_x_copy_Screen_2.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-G413-Logitech-3"><a href="#3-G413-Logitech-3" class="headerlink" title="3.G413 Logitech"></a>3.G413 Logitech</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/g413-logitech.png"                      alt="g413-logitech"                ></p><p>A good keyboard with excellent gaming performance should appeal to the majority of entry-level gamers. We can say Logitech’s G413 is the best gaming keyboard under 100$. Despite its low price, it is well-made, with a plastic body and a strong metal top half so that you will have no problems with it.</p><p>Only patented Romer-G Tactile switches are included, which feature a short pre-travel distance and provide excellent tactile feedback without being too heavy to write on. ABS keycaps feel pleasant to touch and seem to be solid. Thus the keyboard provides excellent typing quality. It offers minimal latency for gamers. Therefore you won’t even notice any lag when playing. It features individually illuminated keys and illumination.

It’s an excellent gaming keyboard featuring a few extra functions to enhance your gaming experience. It’s full-size, with a sturdy frame and superior quality finishing, but still, ABS keycaps aren’t as comfortable as PBT.</p><p>It comes with vertical Kailh Speed Silver and Kailh clicky Speed Bronze keys, both of which we tried, and it’s hot-swappable so that you can use anything you like. Our unit’s clicky ones feature a short pre-travel range and low operational force, making them easy to push for gaming. The delay is also quite common, thus there should be no noticeable lag when gaming.

This mechanical TenKeyLess variant may connect to up to 2 different devices at the same time, either through the USB receiver or over Bluetooth. The ergonomics are excellent since it’s a horizontal keyboard with just one inclination option. However, the wrist rest looks cheap.</p><p>Only linear MX Red Cherry keys are available, which take little effort to activate and provide no tactile feedback. Although the pre-travel length is somewhat greater than that of comparable gaming keyboards, the switches are still extremely sensitive and should not cause fatigue. You can reprogram or assign macros to any key, and it has some additional features like dedicated media buttons and a Windows lockout that stops you from inadvertently minimizing your game.</p><h5

OBS virtual camera enables you to utilize a media resource such as video files, screenshots, apps, games, etc. as the camera output to Meet, or other Video conversations. Your conference partner will see the video source you just specified instead of your face via the camera. One of the most typical concerns that streamers would run across is that their video would, over time, become out of sync with the rest of the broadcast. For example, your microphone audio could line up with your lips at first, but there is a perceptible offset from the camera one hour into a broadcast. Luckily, these video sync difficulties with OBS are generally caused by a sampling rate mismatch. Thanks to its basic well-organized user interface, OBS is pretty easy to use and it operates smoothly as well.</p><p>Assuming you are a post for freeware that can do screen recording properly and profitably, an OBS screen recorder is warmly encouraged. Even better, its outstanding ability is to cope with live spillage by supporting numerous popular web-based features. In video conferencing software like Skype, Zoom, Teams, Google Meet, or Facebook Messenger Rooms, you may notice a video source issue labeled “OBS camera not showing” in the OBS Studio. And you may question what it is and how to utilize the virtual camera Virtually every streamer around the world knows about OBS (Open Broadcaster Software), a free open-sourced streaming and recording application.

Unless Twitch streamers enable Video on Demand, the live stream will not be accessible to the viewers later. However, it is quite possible that you cannot watch a live stream completely because you are occupied with other important works, and that is when you can record Twitch stream so that you can watch it later whenever you have time.</p><p>Even Twitch streamers may want to record their own live streams so that they can upload them on other video streaming and social media platforms. Apart from enabling VOD on Twitch by the streamers, you can record Twitch with a professional screen recorder. In this article, we have illustrated how to record Twitch streams on Windows PC and Mac easily.</p><p>Way 1. <a href="#part1">Save Video with VOD on Twitch</a></p><p>Way 2. <a href="#part2">How to Record Twitch Stream on Windows</a></p><p>Way 3. <a href="#part3">Record Twitch with OBS Studio</a></p><p>Way 4. <a href="#part4">Record Twitch Stream with XSplit</a></p><p>Way 4. <a href="#part4">Record Twitch Lice Stream on Mac</a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://twopages.pxf.io/c/5597632/2016067/18544" target="_top" id="2016067"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18544-2016067"                      border="0" alt="" width="1020" height="380"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2016067/18544"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Way-1-Save-Video-with-VOD-on-Twitch"><a href="#Way-1-Save-Video-with-VOD-on-Twitch" class="headerlink" title="Way 1.

In fact, it has become an equally popular platform among creators and brands as YouTube. That is why creators are willing to upload creative videos and go for live streaming to engage the audiences and get brand deals. You should live stream to Instagram from OBS Studio if you want to stream from your computer.</p><p>Instagram is primarily a mobile app and Instagrammers live stream from their smartphones. However, just like YouTube, you can live stream from your computer if the popular Instagrammers are doing these days. You need OBS Studio which is available for free and it is compatible with Windows, Mac and Linux.

You can live stream on almost any video streaming platform as long as you have the stream URL and stream key. On the other hand, Instagram only allows Instagram Live feature from its app. Therefore, you need a third-party app to obtain the stream URL and stream key so that you can connect OBS Studio with Instagram for live stream.</p><p>There are various third-party apps available to setup OBS Instagram live stream session. We recommend Streamon The application is also available for Windows, Mac and Linux users, just like OBS Studio. Before getting started, you should have the following ready.</p><ul><li>An Instagram account where you want to live stream from your computer.</li><li>Live streaming gadgets such as webcam, external microphone, lights as per your requirements.</li><li>Download and install Streamon as per your operating system.</li><li>Download and install OBS Studio on your computer.</li></ul><p>Here are the steps you have to take to setup OBS Instagram link to start live streaming.</p><p>Step 1: Open OBS Studio on your computer.</p><p>Step 2: Go to Profile&gt; New and name it as “OBS Studio Instagram live“.
