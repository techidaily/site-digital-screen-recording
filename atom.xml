    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Into-the-World-of-Fraps-Screenshots"><a href="#Into-the-World-of-Fraps-Screenshots" class="headerlink" title="Into the World of Fraps Screenshots"></a>Into the World of Fraps Screenshots</h2><p>If you like to record video games, Fraps can help you take your YouTube channel to new heights. Because of its name, it may seem to be a complex program, although it is quite popular among Windows users. This utility is also compatible with games that use OpenGL or DirectX graphics. When it comes to FRAPS, many things raise the standard, but the competition it provides to its counterparts while remaining affordable is unrivaled. Older versions of Windows, such as Windows XP, are also supported by FRAPS. This function is exceptional since it is not available in any other screen recorder. It is, on the other hand, simple to use and has a fluid drag-and-drop feature that elevates it to the top of the hierarchy.</p><p>Fraps is one of the most well-known third-party programs for PC gamers, thanks to its free and simple benchmarking features that can test the performance of almost any game. It’s also a simple method to put a frame rate counter in the corner of your screen to keep an eye on in-game performance second by second. FRAPS can capture up to 7680 x 4800 at bespoke frame rates ranging from 1 to 120 frames per second, making it stand out among its peers. Skype calls from online or video games are among the features available. It can also record sounds through a microphone, making it the most versatile of all the options thus far. There is no way to capture webcam footage or create a timeline. It also can’t add video titles or capture audio from the system. None of these drawbacks, we believe, are relevant to video game recording fans. FRAPS has numerous drawbacks despite its low cost and flexibility.</p><h2 id="1-Download-and-Install"><a href="#1-Download-and-Install" class="headerlink" title="1. Download and Install"></a>1. Download and Install</h2><p>Fraps can also record videos of your gaming sessions, but unlike the other tools in our overview of gameplay capture software, you must pay to use the program’s full video recording features. Minimized start, always on top view, show status on LCD, minimize to system tray exclusively, and more options are available under Fraps’ general settings. Games that utilize OpenGL and DirectX technologies are compatible with the system.</p><p>DOWNLOAD LINK: <a class="link"   href="https://fraps.com/" >FRAPS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="2-How-to-Record-Screen-with-Fraps"><a href="#2-How-to-Record-Screen-with-Fraps" class="headerlink" title="2. How to Record Screen with Fraps"></a>2. How to Record Screen with Fraps</h2><p>**<strong>Step 1:</strong> When you first launch Fraps, you’ll see that there isn’t much to it. There are four tabs in this little window: General, FPS, Movies, and Screenshots.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/fraps.jpg"                      alt="fraps"                ></p><p>**<strong>Step 2:</strong> Fraps’ benchmarking tools are located under the FPS tab. When Fraps is active, the framerate counter is always visible in-game.

Not just recording the screen video, you can capture your screen with audio.

That does not mean you cannot record screen as well as audio with QuickTime. Here are the steps on QuickTime how to record screen with sound.</p><p>Step 1: You will have to install a free extension called SoundFlower so that you can record audio through QuickTime along with recording the screen. Therefore, download <a class="link"   href="https://soundflower.en.softonic.com/mac" >SoundFlower <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> free extension software. The main job of SoundFlower is to channel the audio playing from one application to another. Install SoundFlower application on your Mac from the downloaded file.</p><p>Step 2: Once you have installed SoundFlower on your Mac, restart your computer. This will ensure that there is no issue with QuickTime screen recording with sound.</p><p>Step 3: Go to Apple menu and open System Preferences.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/system-preferences.jpg"                      alt="system preferences"                ></p><p>Step 4: Go to Sound tab and from Sound Output, select SoundFlower(2ch) option.

Launch QuickTime and go to File &gt; New Screen Recording option.</p><p>Step 6: You can start recording anytime you want by pressing the Record button. Make sure that sound source is selected as SoundFlower(2ch) and quality is selected as high.
